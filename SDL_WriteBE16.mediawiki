= SDL_WriteBE16 =
Use this function to write 16 bits in native format to a [[SDL_RWops]] as big-endian data.


== Syntax ==
```c++
size_t SDL_WriteBE16(SDL_RWops* dst,
                     Uint16     value)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|the stream to which data will be written
|-
|'''value'''
|the data to be written, in native format
|}

== Return Value ==

== Remarks ==
SDL byteswaps the data only if necessary, so the application always specifies native format, and the data written will be in big-endian format.
