= SDL_HapticPeriodic =
A structure that contains a template for a Periodic effect.

|^the shape of the waves^ ,,one of the effects handled by this structure,,; see [[#type|Remarks]] for details

|'''direction'''
|direction of the effect ^(relative to the user)^
|-
|
|

|
|
|'''''Trigger'''''
|-
|Uint16

|-
|Uint16
|'''phase'''
|horizontal shift given by ''hundredths'' of a cycle; see [[#phase|Remarks]] for details ^(what is being shifted? Is this what creates the flat tops? What is the definition of a cycle, 1 sec?)^

== Remarks ==
<<Color2(green,There are several typing and grammatical errors in this section of the header. May not require fixing but probably should at least be looked at. Changes from header indicated in italics below.)>>
<span id="type"></span>A periodic effect consists ''of'' a wave-shaped effect that repeats itself over time. The type determines the shape of the wave and the ^other^ parameters determine the dimensions of the wave.

'''type''' may be one of the following:

<<Color2(green,For some reason when these are interpreted in the code box the angle of the slashes is changed and they look funny.  Don't know how to fix that.)>>

<span id="phase"></span>'''phase''' is given by ''hundredths'' of a ''cycle,'' meaning that giving the phase a value of 9000 will displace it 25% of it's period. Here are sample values:
{|
|0
|No phase displacement
|-
|9000
|Displaced 25% of it's period
|-
|18000
|Displaced 50% of it's period
|-
|27000
|Displaced 75% of it's period
|-
|36000
|Displaced 100% of it's period, same as 0, but 0 is ''preferred''
|}
<<Color2(green,This is not at all clear unless it is a common thing that a programmer would know.  Is phase describing the duration of an individual wave from start to finish or the duration from the start of one wave to the start of the next?
