= SDL_RenderLogicalToWindow =

Get real coordinates of point in window when given logical coordinates of point in renderer.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_RenderLogicalToWindow(SDL_Renderer * renderer, 
                                    float logicalX, float logicalY,
                                    int *windowX, int *windowY);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the renderer from which the window coordinates should be calculated
|-
|'''logicalX'''
|the logical x coordinate
|-
|'''logicalY'''
|the logical y coordinate
|-
|'''windowX'''
|the pointer filled with the real X coordinate in the window
|-
|'''windowY'''
|the pointer filled with the real Y coordinate in the window
|}

== Remarks ==

Logical coordinates will differ from real coordinates when render is scaled
and logical renderer size set

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.18.
