= SDL_OpenAudioDevice =
Use this function to open a specific audio device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_AudioDeviceID SDL_OpenAudioDevice(const char*          device,
                                      int                  iscapture,
                                      const SDL_AudioSpec* desired,
                                      SDL_AudioSpec*       obtained,
                                      int                  allowed_changes)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''device'''
|a UTF-8 string reported by [[SDL_GetAudioDeviceName]](); see [[#device|Remarks]]
|-
|'''iscapture'''
|non-0 to specify a device that has recording capability
|-
|'''desired'''
|the desired audio parameters; see [[SDL_OpenAudio]]() for more information
|-
|'''obtained'''
|a pointer to an [[SDL_AudioSpec]] structure to be filled in; see [[SDL_OpenAudio]]() for more information
|-
|'''allowed_changes'''
|0, or one or more flags OR'd together; see [[#allowed|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns a valid device ID that is >= 2 on success or 0 on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information. 

<<Color2(green,Although it is implied here and in Remarks would it be of value to specify that the ID is >=2 because device 1 is already open or is otherwise the default?)>>

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
<span id="device"></span> Passing in a '''device''' name of NULL requests the most reasonable default (and is equivalent to calling [[SDL_OpenAudio]]()).
The '''device''' name is a UTF-8 string reported by [[SDL_GetAudioDeviceName]](), but some drivers allow arbitrary and driver-specific strings, such as a hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the diskaudio driver.

<span id="allowed"></span> '''allowed_changes''' can have the following flags OR'd together:
{|
|SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE
|-
|SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE
|-
|SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE
|-
|SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE
|}

[[SDL_OpenAudio]](), unlike this function, always acts on device ID 1.
