= SDL_GetWindowSize =
Use this function to get the size of a window's client area.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_GetWindowSize(SDL_Window* window,
                       int*        w,
                       int*        h)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window to query the width and height from
|-
|'''w'''
|a pointer filled in with the width of the window, in screen coordinates, may be NULL
|-
|'''h'''
|a pointer filled in with the height of the window, in screen coordinates, may be NULL
|}

== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
NULL can safely be passed as the '''w''' or '''h''' parameter if the width or height value is not desired.

The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if the window was created with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI on a platform with high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or OS X). Use [[SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize]](), [[SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize]](), or [[SDL_GetRendererOutputSize]]() to get the real client area size in pixels.
