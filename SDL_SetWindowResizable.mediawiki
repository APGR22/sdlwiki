== Remarks ==
This will add or remove the window's [[SDL_WindowFlags|SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE]] flag and allow/disallow user resizing of the window.  This is a no-op if the window's resizable state already matches the requested state.

{i} ''Note'': You can't change the resizable state of a fullscreen window.
