= SDL_SetWindowResizable =
Use this function to set the user-resizable state of a window.




== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_SetWindowResizable(SDL_Window* window,
                            SDL_bool    resizable)
</syntaxhighlight>


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window of which to change the resizable state
|-
|'''resizable'''
|SDL_TRUE to allow resizing, SDL_FALSE to disallow
|}



== Remarks ==
This will add or remove the window's [[SDL_WindowFlags|SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE]] flag and allow/disallow user resizing of the window.  This is a no-op if the window's resizable state already matches the requested state.

{i} ''Note'': You can't change the resizable state of a fullscreen window.


== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.5.
