= SDL_SetWindowResizable =

Set the user-resizable state of a window.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SetWindowResizable(SDL_Window * window,
                            SDL_bool resizable);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window of which to change the resizable state
|-
|'''resizable'''
|[[SDL_TRUE]] to allow resizing, [[SDL_FALSE]] to disallow
|}

== Remarks ==

This will add or remove the window's <code>[[SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE]]</code>
flag and allow/disallow user resizing of the window. This is a no-op if the
window's resizable state already matches the requested state.

You can't change the resizable state of a fullscreen window.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.5.
