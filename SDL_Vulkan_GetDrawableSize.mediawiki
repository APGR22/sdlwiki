= SDL_VulkanGetDrawableSize =
Use this function to get the size of the window's underlying drawable dimensions in pixels. This is used for setting viewport sizes, scissor rectangles, and other places where the a ```VkExtent``` might show up in relation to the window.



== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize(SDL_Window* window,
                                int* w,
                                int* h);
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|```SDL_Window``` for which the size is to be queried
|-
|'''w'''
|Pointer to the variable to write the width to or ```NULL```
|-
|'''h'''
|Pointer to the variable to write the height to or ```NULL```
|}


== Code Examples ==
```c++
// may instead choose to use std::clamp() in C++17
#define CLAMP(x, lo, hi)    ((x) < (lo) ? (lo) : (x) > (hi) ? (hi) : (x))

SDL_Window *window;
VkSurfaceKHR surface;
VkPhysicalDevice physicalDevice;

// window = SDL_CreateWindow(...);
if (!SDL_Vulkan_CreateSurface(window, instance, &surface)) {
    // handle error
}
// physicalDevice = ...;

// ...

// Create Swapchain

VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR capabilities;
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(physicalDevice, surface, &capabilities);

int width;
int height;
SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize(window, &width, &height);

width = CLAMP(width, capabilities.minImageExtent.width, capabilities.maxImageExtent.width);
height = CLAMP(height, capabilities.minImageExtent.height, capabilities.maxImageExtent.height);

// ...

// vkCreateSwapchainKHR(...);
```

== Remarks ==

This may differ from [[SDL_GetWindowSize]] if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with ```SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI``` on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the {{{SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED}}} hint.

== Version ==
This function is available in SDL 2.0.8
