= SDL_SetTextureColorMod =
Use this function to set an additional color value multiplied into render copy operations.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetTextureColorMod(SDL_Texture* texture,
                           Uint8        r,
                           Uint8        g,
                           Uint8        b)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to update
|-
|'''r'''
|the red color value multiplied into copy operations
|-
|'''g'''
|the green color value multiplied into copy operations
|-
|'''b'''
|the blue color value multiplied into copy operations
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
...
SDL_Texture* pTexture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface( renderer, loadedSurface );
SDL_SetTextureColorMod( pTexture, 64, 64, 64 );
...
```

== Remarks ==
When this texture is rendered, during the copy operation each source color channel is modulated by the appropriate color value according to the following formula:
 <code>srcC = srcC * (color / 255)</code>

Color modulation is not always supported by the renderer; it will return -1 if color modulation is not supported.
