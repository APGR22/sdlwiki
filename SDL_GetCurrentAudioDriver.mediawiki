= SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver =
Use this function to return the name of the current audio driver.


== Syntax ==
```c++
const char* SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver(void)
```

== Return Value ==
Returns the name of the current audio driver or NULL if no driver has been initialized.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
const char* driver_name = SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver();

if ( driver_name ) {
    printf("Audio subsystem initialized; driver = %s.\n", driver_name);
} else {
    printf("Audio subsystem not initialized.\n");
}
```

== Remarks ==
The returned string points to internal static memory and thus never becomes invalid, even if you quit the audio subsystem and initialize a new driver (although such a case would return a different static string from another call to this function, of course). As such, you should not modify or free the returned string.
