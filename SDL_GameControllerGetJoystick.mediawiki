= SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick =
Use this function to get the Joystick ID from a Game Controller. The game controller builds on the Joystick API, but to be able to use the Joystick's functions with a gamepad, you need to use this first to get the joystick object.




== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Joystick joy =  SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick(SDL_GameController* cont)
```

<!-- #Fill in the above syntax per the Style Guide, then delete this comment. -->


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''SDL_GameController'''
|The game controller object that you want to get a Joystick object from.
|}

<!-- #Fill in the above table per the Style Guide, then delete this comment. -->


== Return Value ==
Returns a SDL_Joystick object; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.


== Code Examples ==
```c++
#include <cstdio> //printf function
. . .
SDL_GameController *ctrl;
SDL_Joystick *joy;
for(int i = 0; i < SDL_NumJoysticks(); i++)
{
  if (SDL_IsGameController(i))
  {
    printf("Index \'%i\' is a compatible controller, named \'%s\'\n", i, SDL_GameControllerNameForIndex(i));
    ctrl = SDL_GameControllerOpen(i);
    joy = SDL_GameControllerGetJoystick(ctrl);
  }
  else
  {
    cout << "Index \'" << i << "\' is not a compatible controller." << endl;
  }
}
```

== Remarks ==
This function will give you a SDL_Joystick object, which allows you to use the SDL_Joystick functions with a SDL_GameController object. This would be useful for getting a joystick's position at any given time, even if it hasn't moved (moving it would produce an event, which would have the axis' value).
