= SDL_HapticCondition =
A structure that contains a template for a Condition effect.


== Data Fields ==
<<Color2(green,Section title formats should be adjusted to match [[SDL_HapticConstant]] once a final format is decided.)>>

{|
|
|
|''Header''
|-
|Uint16
|'''type'''
|one of the effects handled by this structure; see [[#type|Remarks]] for details
|-
|<style="color: #808080;">[[SDL_HapticDirection]]
|<style="color: #808080;">'''direction'''
|<style="color: #808080;">direction of the effect - not used at the moment; see [[#direction|Remarks]] for details
|-
|
|
|''Replay''
|-
|Uint32
|'''length'''
|duration of the effect
|-
|Uint16
|'''delay'''
|delay before starting the effect
|-
|
|
|''Trigger''
|-
|Uint16
|'''button'''
|button that triggers the effect
|-
|Uint16
|'''interval'''
|how soon it can be triggered again after button
|-
|
|
|''Condition''
|-
|Uint16
|'''right_sat'''
|level when joystick is to the positive side
|-
|Uint16
|'''left_sat'''
|level when joystick is to the negative side
|-
|Sint16
|'''right_coeff'''
|how fast to increase the force towards the positive side
|-
|Sint16
|'''left_coeff'''
|how fast to increase the force towards the negative side
|-
|Uint16
|'''deadband'''
|size of the dead zone ^(units)?^
|-
|Sint16
|'''center'''
|position of the dead zone
|}
<<Color2(green,All of the Condition fields had a [3] that was left out. Should it be in?)>>

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
<span id="type"></span>'''type''' may be one of the following:
{|
|SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING
|effect based on ^axis position/axes positions^?
|-
|SDL_HAPTIC_DAMPER
|effect based on ^axis velocity/axes velocities^?
|-
|SDL_HAPTIC_INERTIA
|effect based on ^axis/axes acceleration^?
|-
|SDL_HAPTIC_FRICTION
|effect based on ^axis/axes movement/movements^?
|}

<span id="direction"></span> '''direction''' is ^currently^ handled by condition internals instead of a direction member.  The condition effect specific members have three parameters. The first refers to the X axis, the second refers to the Y axis and the third refers to the Z axis. The right terms refer to the positive side of the axis and the left terms refer to the negative side of the axis. Please refer to the [[SDL_HapticDirection]] diagram for which side is positive and which is negative.
