= SDL_HapticCondition =
A structure that contains a template for a condition effect.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Header''
|-
|Uint16
|'''type'''
|one of the effects handled by this structure; see [[#type|Remarks]] for details
|-
|<style="color: #808080;">[[SDL_HapticDirection]]
|<style="color: #808080;">'''direction'''
|<style="color: #808080;">direction of the effect - not used at the moment; see [[#direction|Remarks]] for details
|-
|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Replay''
|-
|Uint32
|'''length'''
|duration of the effect
|-
|Uint16
|'''delay'''
|delay before starting the effect
|-
|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Trigger''
|-
|Uint16
|'''button'''
|button that triggers the effect
|-
|Uint16
|'''interval'''
|how soon it can be triggered again after button
|-
|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Condition''
|-
|Uint16
|'''right_sat'''
|level when joystick is to the positive side; max 0xFFFF
|-
|Uint16
|'''left_sat'''
|level when joystick is to the negative side; max 0xFFFF
|-
|Sint16
|'''right_coeff'''
|how fast to increase the force towards the positive side
|-
|Sint16
|'''left_coeff'''
|how fast to increase the force towards the negative side
|-
|Uint16
|'''deadband'''
|size of the dead zone; max 0xFFFF: whole axis-range when 0-centered ^(units)?^
|-
|Sint16
|'''center'''
|position of the dead zone
|}
<!-- <span style="color: green;">All of the Condition fields had a [3] that was left out. Should it be in?</span> -->

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
<span id="type"></span>'''type''' may be one of the following:
{|
|SDL_HAPTIC_SPRING
|effect based on axis position/axes positions?
|-
|SDL_HAPTIC_DAMPER
|effect based on axis velocity/axes velocities?
|-
|SDL_HAPTIC_INERTIA
|effect based on axis/axes acceleration?
|-
|SDL_HAPTIC_FRICTION
|effect based on axis/axes movement/movements?
|}

<span id="direction"></span> '''direction''' is (currently) handled by condition internals instead of a direction member.  The condition effect specific members have three parameters. The first refers to the X axis, the second refers to the Y axis and the third refers to the Z axis. The right terms refer to the positive side of the axis and the left terms refer to the negative side of the axis. Please refer to the [[SDL_HapticDirection]] diagram for which side is positive and which is negative.
