= SDL_FillRects =
Use this function to perform a fast fill of a set of rectangles with a specific color.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_FillRects(SDL_Surface*    dst,
                  const SDL_Rect* rects,
                  int             count,
                  Uint32          color)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the drawing target
|-
|'''rects'''
|an array of [[SDL_Rect]] structures representing the rectangles to be filled
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of rectangles in the array
|-
|'''color'''
|the color to fill with; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
'''color''' should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be generated by [[SDL_MapRGB]]() or [[SDL_MapRGBA]]().  If the color value contains an alpha component then the destination is simply filled with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via [[SDL_SetClipRect]]()), then this function will fill based on the intersection of the clip rectangle and '''rects'''.
