                  Uint32           color)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|the destination [[SDL_Surface]] structure ,,containing the rectangles,,
|-
|'''rects'''
|an array of [[SDL_Rect]] structures representing the rectangles to fill^ , or NULL to fill the entire render target^
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of rectangles in the array
|-
|'''color'''
