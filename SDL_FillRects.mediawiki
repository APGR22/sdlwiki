```c++
int SDL_FillRects(SDL_Surface*     dst,
                  const SDL_Rect** rects,
                  int              count,
                  Uint32           color)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|a pointer to the destination surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing the rectangles
|-
|'''rects'''
|a pointer to a pointer containing the rectangles / [[SDL_Rect]]s to fill
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of rectangles to fill
|-
|'''color'''
|the color to fill the rectangles with
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

If '''rects''' is NULL, the whole surface will be filled with color. <<Color2(green,Is this note applicable to this function?)>>

,,The,, '''color''' should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be generated by the [[SDL_MapRGB]]() function.
