== Introduction ==

^There are some^ System dependent library loading routines.
: ,,Some,, things to keep in mind:
* These functions only work on C function names.  Other languages may have name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from compiler to compiler.
* Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling convention as the actual library function.  Your code will crash mysteriously if you do not do this.
* Avoid namespace collisions.  If you load a symbol from the library, it is not defined ,,whether or not,, ^as to whether^ it goes into the global symbol namespace for the application ^or not^.  If it does and it conflicts with symbols in your code or other shared libraries, you will not get the results you expect. :)  ''or''  ;)
