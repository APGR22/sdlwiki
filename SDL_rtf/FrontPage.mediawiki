= SDL_rtf 2.0 =

This library allows you to display simple Rich Text Format (RTF) files in SDL applications.

The RTF format specification is available at [https://interoperability.blob.core.windows.net/files/Archive_References/%5bMSFT-RTF%5d.pdf windows.net].

The showrtf example application relies on the [https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf SDL_ttf library] for loading
fonts and displaying text.

To make the library, type './configure' then 'make' to build the SDL rtf library and the showrtf example application.

This library is under the zlib license, see the file [https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_rtf/blob/main/LICENSE.txt LICENSE.txt] for details.
