= SDL_EventState =
Use this function to set the state of processing ,,certain,, events ^by '''type'''^.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Uint8 SDL_EventState(Uint32 type,
                     int    state)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''type'''
|^the type of event to be processed / regulated???; see [[SDL_Event]] for details^
|-
|'''state'''
|^how to process the event '''type'''^; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
<<Color2(green,These RVs are a total guess...)>>

Returns an 8-bit bitmask of the current processing '''state''' (see [[#Remarks|Remarks]]): 1 if the event is processed successfully, 0 if it is ignored or disabled, or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
'''state''' may be any of the following:
{|
|SDL_QUERY
|-1
|returns the current processing state of the specified event '''type'''
|-
|SDL_IGNORE
|0
|the event '''type''' will automatically be dropped from the event queue and will not be filtered
|-
|SDL_DISABLE
|0
|^same as SDL_IGNORE^ ???  ^the event '''type''' will not be processed^ ???
|-
|SDL_ENABLE
|1
|the event '''type''' will be processed normally
|}
<<Color2(green,Are the #s above the RVs or should they be removed?  The current header does not specify the word "type" but it seems relevant.  Should it remain or be removed above?)>>

<<Color2(green,Below is the verbatim language from the header. Thought it might be better in table form above...)>>

If state is set to SDL_IGNORE, that event will be automatically dropped from the event queue and will not event be filtered.<br/>
If state is set to SDL_ENABLE, that event will be processed normally.<br/>
If state is set to SDL_QUERY, [[SDL_EventState]]() will return the current processing state of the specified event.

*<<Color2(green,Does the following still apply in 1.3?  SDL_VideoInfo seems to be a read-only struct.  Should it have a page?)>><br/>
[[SDL_EventState]]() must be called following the [[SDL_VideoInfo]] call. Otherwise the back-end data structure will be erased.*
