= Style Guide: Remarks =
All [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#api API pages] in this wiki contain a section for remarks.  This guide provides instructions for adding your own content to the Remarks section of these pages. 

<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
'''The Remarks section provides additional information related to other sections on the page as well as a location for users to add comments related to real-world application of the API.'''

Please post your appropriate remarks that may benefit other users.  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.
* Remarks should have adequate references to make them clear and useful.
* Please remember to keep it simple and easy to understand.

For additional assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide.

----
== Adding Your Remarks ==
Place your remark in the ```== Remarks ==``` section:
{|
|<width="30%" bgcolor="#EDEDED">If...
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">Then...
|-
|your remark is the __first on the page__
|replace the following with your remarks<br/>```''You can add useful comments here''```
|-
|there are __existing remarks__ on the page
|add your remarks to the ''end'' of the Remarks section,<br/>or to a related grouping if there are existing remarks covering the same topic
|-
|
|''Example'': [[SDL_MixAudio]]()
|}

----
== Formatting Your Remarks ==

=== Referencing Function Parameters ===
When your remark includes a reference to a function parameter:
{|
|<width="30%" bgcolor="#EDEDED">If...
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">Then...
|-
|<|3>a parameter __on the same page__ is referenced
|use '''bold''' wherever the name is used in the remark
|-
|''Markup'':  3 apostrophes surrounding the text for bold<br/>```'''parameter'''``` = '''parameter'''
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_ConvertAudio]]()
|-
|<|3>a parameter __from another page__ is referenced
|use <code>monospace</code> wherever the name is used in the remark
|-
|''Markup'':  a single backtick surrounding the text for monospace<br/>```<code>member</code>``` = <code>member</code>
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_OpenAudio]]()
|}


=== Referencing Structure Data Fields ===
When your remark includes a reference to a structure data field:
* use the same formatting as for function parameters above.
: ''Example'': [[SDL_AudioSpec]]


=== Referencing Enumeration Values ===
When your remark includes a reference to an enumeration value:
* no special formatting is required since these are generally already in ALL CAPS.
: ''Example'': [[SDL_GLattr]]


=== Referencing Other API Components ===
When your remark includes a reference to an existing function, enumeration, or structure:
* Create a hyperlink to its page

  {i} ~-''Although the wiki will automatically create links in many cases, it does not recognize the SDL names correctly so you must manually hyperlink them.''-~<br/>

: ''Markup'':  use two brackets surrounding the page name (must be exact) for a link.

{|
|<width="30%" bgcolor="#EDEDED">If...
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">Then...
|-
|<|2>it is a __function__
|include open and closed parentheses outside of the hyperlink markup
|-
|```[[SDL_Function]]()``` = [[SDL_Function]]()
|-
|<|2>it is a __structure__ or __enumeration__
|do not use parentheses
|-
|```[[SDL_Enumeration/Structure]]```
|-
|
|''Example'': [[SDL_SetTextureScaleMode]]()
|}
