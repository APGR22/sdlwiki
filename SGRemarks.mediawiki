= Style Guide: Remarks =
All [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#api API pages] in this wiki contain a section for remarks.  This guide provides instructions for adding your own content to the Remarks section of these pages. 

<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
'''The Remarks section provides additional information related to other sections on the page as well as a location for users to add comments related to real-world application of the API.'''

Please post your appropriate remarks that may benefit other users.  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.
* Remarks should have adequate references to make them clear and useful.
* Please remember to keep it simple and easy to understand.

For assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide.


== Adding the First Remark ==

Replace the following with your remarks:
 ```''You can add useful comments here''```


== Adding Additional Remarks ==
Add your remarks to the end of the Remarks section, or to a related grouping if there are existing remarks covering the same topic.
 ''Example'': [[SDL_MixAudio]]()

[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]


== Formatting Remarks ==

=== Referencing Function Parameters ===
''If the reference is to a parameter on that page:''
* Use '''bold''' wherever the name is used in the remark
:''Markup'':  use 3 apostrophes surrounding the text for bold.
    ```'''parameter'''``` = '''parameter'''
: ''Example'': [[SDL_ConvertAudio]]()
: ''Example'': [[SDL_AudioSpec]]
If the reference is to a parameter from another function:
* Use <code>monospace</code> wherever the name is used in the remark
:''Markup'':  use a single backtick surrounding the text for monospace.
    ```<code>member</code>``` = <code>member</code>
: ''Example'': [[SDL_OpenAudio]]()


=== Referencing Structure Data Fields ===
Same as for function parameters above.


=== Referencing Enumeration Values ===
These are generally in ALL CAPS anyway and do not require special formatting.
: ''Example'': [[SDL_GLattr]]


=== Referencing Other API Components ===
If you reference an existing function, enumeration, or structure:
* Create a hyperlink to its page

  {i} ~-''Although the wiki will automatically create links in many cases, it does not recognize the SDL names correctly so you must manually hyperlink them.''-~<br/>

: ''Markup'':  use two brackets surrounding the page name (must be exact) for a link.
: Include open and closed parentheses outside of the hyperlink markup after a function name.
     ```[[SDL_Function]]()``` = [[SDL_Function]]()
: Do not use parentheses for enumerations or structures.
:```[[SDL_Enumeration/Structure]]```
: ''Example'': [[SDL_SetTextureScaleMode]]()
