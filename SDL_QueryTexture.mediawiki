int SDL_QueryTexture(SDL_TextureID textureID,
                     Uint32*       format, 
                     int*          access,
                     int*          w, 
                     int*          h)
```

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''textureID'''
|a texture to be queried
|-

|a pointer filled in with the width of the texture in pixels
|-
|'''h'''
