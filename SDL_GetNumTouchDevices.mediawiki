= SDL_GetNumTouchDevices =

Get the number of registered touch devices.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetNumTouchDevices(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns the number of registered touch devices.



== Remarks ==

On some platforms SDL first sees the touch device if it was actually used.
Therefore [[SDL_GetNumTouchDevices]]() may return 0 although devices are
available. After using all devices at least once the number will be
correct.

This was fixed for Android in SDL 2.0.1.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
