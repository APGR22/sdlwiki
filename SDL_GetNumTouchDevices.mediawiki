== Remarks ==
On some platforms SDL first sees the touch device if it was actually used.
Therefore [[SDL_GetNumTouchDevices]]() may return 0 although devices are available.
After using all devices at least once the number will be correct.

This was fixed for Android in SDL 2.0.1.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
