= SDL_DestroyMutex =
Use this function to destroy a mutex created with [[SDL_CreateMutex]]().


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_DestroyMutex(SDL_mutex* mutex)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''mutex''' 
|the mutex to destroy
|}


== Code Examples ==
<<Include(SDL_CreateMutex, , , from="## Begin Mutex Example", to="## End Mutex Example")>>

== Remarks ==
This function must be called on any mutex that is no longer needed. Failure to destroy a mutex will result in a system memory or resource leak. While it is safe to destroy a mutex that is UNLOCKED, it is not safe to attempt to destroy a locked mutex and may result in undefined behavior depending on the platform.
