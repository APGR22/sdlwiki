= SDL_DestroyMutex =

Destroy a mutex created with [[SDL_CreateMutex]]().

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_DestroyMutex(SDL_mutex * mutex);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''mutex'''
|the mutex to destroy
|}

== Remarks ==

This function must be called on any mutex that is no longer needed.
Failure to destroy a mutex will result in a system memory or resource leak.
While it is safe to destroy a mutex that is _unlocked_, it is not safe to
attempt to destroy a locked mutex, and may result in undefined behavior
depending on the platform.
