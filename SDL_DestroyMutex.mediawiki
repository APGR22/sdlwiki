= SDL_DestroyMutex =
Use this function to destroy a mutex.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_DestroyMutex(SDL_mutex* mutex)
```
== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''mutex''' 
|^the mutex to destroy^ 
|}


== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_mutex *mutex;

//First create the mutex..
mutex = SDL_CreateMutex();

// ... use mutex in code


// When done using the mutex, destroy it

// MAKE sure to unlock the mutex prior to destroying it
if( SDL_mutexV( mutex ) )
  printf("\nSDL Mutex unlock error:%s", SDL_GetError());
else
  // When done with the mutex delete it
  SDL_DestroyMutex( mutex );
```
== Remarks ==
SDL_DestroyMutex must be called on any mutex that is no longer needed. Failure to destroy a mutex will result in a system memory or resource leak. While it is safe to destroy a mutex that is UNLOCKED, it is not safe to attempt to destroy a locked mutex and may result in undefined behavior depending on the platform.

Any attempt to reference a mutex after it has been destroyed will cause access to an invalid memory pointer which may lead to memory corruption or a segmentation fault.
