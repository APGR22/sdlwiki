= SDL_SetEventFilter =
Use this function to set up a filter to process all events before they change internal state and are posted to the internal event queue.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_SetEventFilter(SDL_EventFilter filter,
                        void*           userdata)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''filter'''
|^typedef int (SDLCALL * SDL_EventFilter) (void *userdata, SDL_Event * event); ???  the SDL_EventFilter to be referenced/run ???^
|-
|'''userdata'''
|^a pointer filled with user-specified information to be filtered^
|}

<<Color2(green,Should SDL_EventFilter have a page? Be detailed in Remarks?  Is userdata an exception to the 'pointer rule'?)>>

== Code Examples ==
<<Color2(green,Does this belong in Syntax or Remarks instead?)>>
```c++
The filter is protypted as:
 int SDL_EventFilter(void *userdata, SDL_Event * event);
```
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If the ^resulting^ filter returns 1, then the event will be added to the internal queue.
If it returns 0, then the event will be dropped from the queue, but the internal state will still be updated.  This allows selective filtering of dynamically arriving events.

/!\ Be very careful of what you do in the event filter function, as it may run in a different thread!

There is one caveat when dealing with the SDL_QUITEVENT event type.  The event filter is only called when the window manager desires to close the application window.  If the event filter returns 1, then the window will be closed, otherwise the window will remain open if possible.

If the quit event is generated by an interrupt signal, it will bypass the internal queue and be delivered to the application at the next event poll.

*Note: Events pushed onto the queue with [[SDL_PushEvent]]() or [[SDL_PeepEvents]]() do not get passed through the event filter.*
