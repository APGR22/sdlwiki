= SDL_GetAudioDeviceSpec =

Get the preferred audio format of a specific audio device.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetAudioDeviceSpec(int index,
                           int iscapture,
                           SDL_AudioSpec *spec);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''index'''
|the index of the audio device; valid values range from 0 to [[SDL_GetNumAudioDevices]]() - 1
|-
|'''iscapture'''
|non-zero to query the list of recording devices, zero to query the list of output devices.
|-
|'''spec'''
|The [[SDL_AudioSpec]] to be initialized by this function.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success, nonzero on error



== Remarks ==

This function is only valid after a successfully initializing the audio
subsystem. The values returned by this function reflect the latest call to
[[SDL_GetNumAudioDevices]](); re-call that function to redetect available
hardware.

<code>spec</code> will be filled with the sample rate, sample format, and
channel count. All other values in the structure are filled with 0. When
the supported struct members are 0, SDL was unable to get the property from
the backend.
