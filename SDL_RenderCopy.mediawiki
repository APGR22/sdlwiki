= SDL_RenderCopy =
Use this function to copy a portion of the texture to the current rendering target.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_TextureID   textureID,
                   const SDL_Rect* srcrect,
                   const SDL_Rect* dstrect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''textureID'''
|the source texture; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|a pointer to the source rectangle, or NULL for the entire texture
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|a pointer to the destination rectangle, or NULL for the entire rendering target
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success, or -1 if there is no rendering context current or the
driver doesn't support the requested operation; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The texture is blended with the destination based on its blend mode set with [[SDL_SetTextureBlendMode]]().

The texture color is affected based on the color modulation set by [[SDL_SetTextureColorMod]]().  

The texture alpha is affected based on the alpha modulation set by [[SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod]]().
