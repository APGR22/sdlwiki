== Syntax ==
```c++
Uint8 SDL_GetRelativeMouseState(int  index,
                                int* x,
                                int* y)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''index'''
|the index of the specified mouse
|-
|'''x'''
|a pointer filled with the relative x coordinate of the mouse
|-
|'''y'''
|a pointer filled with the relative y coordinate of the mouse
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns an 8 bit button bitmask of the relative button state. ??? 

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can be tested using the SDL_BUTTON(X) macros, and '''x''' and '''y''' are set to the mouse deltas since the last call to [[SDL_GetRelativeMouseState]]().

== Related Functions ==
:[[SDL_GetMouseState]] ??? Because it's essentially the same a different way
