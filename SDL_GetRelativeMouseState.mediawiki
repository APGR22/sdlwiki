= SDL_GetRelativeMouseState =

Retrieve the relative state of the mouse.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
Uint32 SDL_GetRelativeMouseState(int *x, int *y);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''x'''
|a pointer filled with the last recorded x coordinate of the mouse
|-
|'''y'''
|a pointer filled with the last recorded y coordinate of the mouse
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a 32-bit button bitmask of the relative button state.



== Remarks ==

The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can be
tested using the <code>[[SDL_BUTTON]](X)</code> macros (where
<code>X</code> is generally 1 for the left, 2 for middle, 3 for the right
button), and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are set to the mouse deltas
since the last call to [[SDL_GetRelativeMouseState]]() or since event
initialization. You can pass NULL for either <code>x</code> or
<code>y</code>.
