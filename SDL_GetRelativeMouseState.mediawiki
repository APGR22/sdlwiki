= SDL_GetRelativeMouseState =
Use this function to retrieve the relative state of the mouse.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Uint32 SDL_GetRelativeMouseState(int* x,
                                 int* y)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''x'''
|a pointer filled with the last recorded x coordinate of the mouse
|-
|'''y'''
|a pointer filled with the last recorded y coordinate of the mouse
|}

<!-- <span style="color: green;">Should this be an exception to the 'pointer rule'?</span> -->

== Return Value ==
Returns a 32 bit button bitmask of the relative button state.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can be tested using the SDL_BUTTON(X) macros (where X is generally 1 for the left, 2 for middle, 3 for the right button), and '''x''' and '''y''' are set to the mouse deltas since the last call to [[SDL_GetRelativeMouseState]]() or since event initialization. You can pass NULL for either '''x''' or '''y'''.
