= SDL_GetMouseState =
Use this function to retrieve the current state of the mouse.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Uint32 SDL_GetMouseState(int* x,
                         int* y)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''x'''
|^the x coordinate of the mouse cursor position relative to the focus window^
|-
|'''y'''
|^the y coordinate of the mouse cursor position relative to the focus window^
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns a 32 bit button bitmask of the current button state.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_PumpEvents();
if(SDL_GetMouseState(NULL, NULL)&SDL_BUTTON(1))
  printf("Mouse Button 1(left) is pressed.\n");
```

== Remarks ==
The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can be tested using the SDL_BUTTON(X) macros *(where X is generally 1 for the left, 2 for middle, 3 for the right button)*, and '''x''' and '''y''' are set to the mouse cursor position relative to the focus window for the current,,ly selected,, mouse. You can pass NULL for either '''x''' or '''y'''.
