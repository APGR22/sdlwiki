= SDL_BuildAudioCVT =

Use this function to initialize a SDL_AudioCVT structure for conversion.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_BuildAudioCVT (SDL_AudioCVT*   cvt, 
                       SDL_AudioFormat src_format, 
                       Uint8           src_channels, 
                       int             src_rate, 
                       SDL_AudioFormat dst_format, 
                       Uint8           dst_channels, 
                       int             dst_rate)
```
== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''cvt'''
|A pointer to an [SDL_AudioCVT] structure that is filled in with audio conversion information.
|-
|'''src_format'''
|The source format of the audio data. For more info see SDL_AudioFormat.
|-
|'''src_channels'''
|The number of channels in the source.
|-
|'''src_rate'''
|The frequency or samples-per-second of the source.
|-
|'''dst_format'''
|The destination format of the audio data.
|-
|'''dst_channels'''
|The number of channels in the destination.
|-
|'''dst_rate'''
|The frequency or samples-per-second of the destination.
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns -1 if the format conversion is not supported, 0 if there's no conversion needed, or 1 if the audio filter is set up.

== Remarks ==
Before an [[SDL_AudioCVT]] structure can be used to convert audio data it must be initialized with source and destination information.
