= SDL_BuildAudioCVT =

Use this function to initialize a SDL_AudioCVT structure for conversion.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_BuildAudioCVT (SDL_AudioCVT*   cvt, 
                       SDL_AudioFormat src_format, 
                       Uint8           src_channels, 
                       int             src_rate, 
                       SDL_AudioFormat dst_format, 
                       Uint8           dst_channels, 
                       int             dst_rate)
```
== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''cvt'''
|A pointer to an SDL_AudioCVT structure that is filled in with audio conversion information.
|-
|'''src_format'''
|The source format of the audio data.
|-
|'''src_channels'''
|The number of channels in the source.
|-
|'''src_rate'''
|The frequency or samples-per-second of the source.
|-
|'''dst_format'''
|The destination format of the audio data.
|-
|'''dst_channels'''
|The number of channels in the destination.
|-
|'''dst_rate'''
|The frequency or samples-per-second of the destination.
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 if the filter could not be built or a strictly positive number if it could.
== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
Before an SDL_AudioCVT structure can be used to convert audio data it must be initialized with source and destination information.

For information on audio formats see [[SDL_AudioSpec]].

''Currently (SDL-1.2.11) only rate conversions of 2x and (1/2)x with x > 0 are done, nearing the requested rate conversion.''
