'''Include File(s):''' [http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/68dfd6df47da/include/SDL_version.h SDL_version.h]


== Introduction ==

These functions are used to collect or display information about the version of SDL that is currently being used by the program.

: The version number consists of three segments (X.Y.Z)
* X = '''Major Version''', which increments with massive changes, additions, and enhancements
* Y = '''Minor Version''', which increments with backwards-compatible changes to the major revision
* Z = '''Patchlevel''', which increments with fixes to the minor revision<br/>
 ''Example:'' The current version is 1.3.0

{i} There are four (4) macros ''(<<Color2(green,Need to create a link to a resource that introduces macros.)>>)'' that apply to this header.

* [[SDL_VERSION]]
* This macro gathers information from SDL_MAJOR_VERSION, SDL_MINOR_VERSION, AND SDL_PATCHLEVEL (#defines) and fills the structure [[SDL_version]] with that information.
* [[SDL_version#Related_Minor_Macros|SDL_VERSIONNUM]]
* A minor macro that converts version numbers into a numeric value.
* [[SDL_version#Related_Minor_Macros|SDL_COMPILEDVERSION]]
* A minor macro that produces the current SDL version number (major.minor.patchlevel)
* [[SDL_version#Related_Minor_Macros|SDL_VERSION_ATLEAST]]
* A minor macro that confirms whether a program was compiled with a version no older than the specified version.
