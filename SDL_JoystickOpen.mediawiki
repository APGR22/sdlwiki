= SDL_JoystickOpen =
Use this function to open a joystick for use.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Joystick* SDL_JoystickOpen(int device_index)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''device_index'''
|the index of the joystick to query
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns a joystick identifier or NULL if an error occurred; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_Joystick *joy;

// Initialize the joystick subsystem
SDL_InitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK);

// Check for joystick
if(SDL_NumJoysticks()>0){
  // Open joystick
  joy=SDL_JoystickOpen(0);
  
  if(joy)
  {
    printf("Opened Joystick 0\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", SDL_JoystickName(0));
    printf("Number of Axes: %d\n", SDL_JoystickNumAxes(joy));
    printf("Number of Buttons: %d\n", SDL_JoystickNumButtons(joy));
    printf("Number of Balls: %d\n", SDL_JoystickNumBalls(joy));
  }
  else
    printf("Couldn't open Joystick 0\n");
  
  // Close if opened
  if(SDL_JoystickGetAttached(joy))
    SDL_JoystickClose(joy);
}
```

== Remarks ==
The index passed as an argument refers to the N'th joystick on the system.  This index is the value which will identify this joystick in future joystick events.  <<Color2(green,Should index be changed to '''device_index''' or leave it as is per the header because it is not being used as the param name here? Does this function effectively set the index number of each joystick device?)>>

*<br/>Remember to initialize the joystick subsystem<br/>* <<Color2(green,The joystick subsystem must be initialized before a joystick can be opened for use.)>>
