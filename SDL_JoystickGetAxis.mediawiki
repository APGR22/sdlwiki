= SDL_JoystickGetAxis =
Use this function to get the current state of an axis control on a joystick.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Sint16 SDL_JoystickGetAxis(SDL_Joystick* joystick,
                           int           axis)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''joystick'''
|an SDL_Joystick structure containing joystick information ???
|-
|'''axis'''
|^the axis to query^; the axis indices start at index 0; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
*<br/>Returns a 16-bit signed integer representing the current position of the axis ^or 0 on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information^.<br/>*

The state is a value ranging from -32768 to 32767. <<Color2(green,Is this the RV or a Remark?)>>

== Code Examples ==
```c++
Sint16 x_move, y_move;
SDL_Joystick *joy1;
.
.
x_move=SDL_JoystickGetAxis(joy1, 0);
y_move=SDL_JoystickGetAxis(joy1, 1);
```

== Remarks ==
*<br/>On most modern joysticks the X axis is usually represented by '''axis''' 0 and the Y axis by '''axis''' 1. The value returned by [[SDL_JoystickGetAxis]]() is a signed integer (-32768 to 32767) representing the current position of the axis.  It may be necessary to impose certain tolerances on these values to account for jitter.

Some joysticks use axes 2 and 3 for extra buttons.<br/>*
