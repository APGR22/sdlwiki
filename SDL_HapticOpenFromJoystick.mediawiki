= SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick =
Use this function to open a __H__aptic device for ,,usage,, ^use^ from a Joystick device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Haptic* SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick(SDL_Joystick* joystick)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''joystick'''
|^a pointer to a^ joystick to create a haptic device from
|}

You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
You must still close the haptic device seperately. It will not be closed with the joystick.

When ,,opening,, ^opened^ from a joystick you should first close the haptic device before closing the joystick device. If not, on some implementations the haptic device will also get unallocated and you'll be unable to use force feedback on that device.
