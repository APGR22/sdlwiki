= SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick =

== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Haptic* SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick(SDL_Joystick* joystick)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''joystick'''

```

== Remarks ==
You must still close the haptic device seperately. It will not be closed with the joystick.

When ,,opening,, ^opened^ from a joystick you should first close the haptic device before closing the joystick device. If not, on some implementations the haptic device will also get unallocated and you'll be unable to use force feedback on that device.
