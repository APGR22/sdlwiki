= SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick =
Use this function to open a haptic device for use from a joystick device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Haptic* SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick(SDL_Joystick* joystick)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''joystick'''
|the SDL_Joystick to create a haptic device from
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns a valid haptic device identifier on success or NULL on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
You must still close the haptic device separately. It will not be closed with the joystick.

When opened from a joystick you should first close the haptic device before closing the joystick device. If not, on some implementations the haptic device will also get unallocated and you'll be unable to use force feedback on that device.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
