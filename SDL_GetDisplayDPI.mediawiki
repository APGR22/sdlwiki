= SDL_GetDisplayDPI =

Get the dots/pixels-per-inch for a display.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetDisplayDPI(int displayIndex, float * ddpi, float * hdpi, float * vdpi);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''displayIndex'''
|the index of the display from which DPI information should be queried
|-
|'''ddpi'''
|a pointer filled in with the diagonal DPI of the display; may be NULL
|-
|'''hdpi'''
|a pointer filled in with the horizontal DPI of the display; may be NULL
|-
|'''vdpi'''
|a pointer filled in with the vertical DPI of the display; may be NULL
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

Diagonal, horizontal and vertical DPI can all be optionally returned if the
appropriate parameter is non-NULL.

A failure of this function usually means that either no DPI information is
available or the <code>displayIndex</code> is out of range.

'''WARNING''': This reports the DPI that the hardware reports, and it is
not always reliable! It is almost always better to use
[[SDL_GetWindowSize]]() to find the window size, which might be in logical
points instead of pixels, and then [[SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize]](),
[[SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize]](), [[SDL_Metal_GetDrawableSize]](), or
[[SDL_GetRendererOutputSize]](), and compare the two values to get an
actual scaling value between the two. We will be rethinking how high-dpi
details should be managed in SDL3 to make things more consistent, reliable,
and clear.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.4.
