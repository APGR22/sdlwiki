= SDL_FlushEvent =
Use this function to clear events from the event queue.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_FlushEvent(Uint32 type)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''type'''
|the type of event to be cleared; see [[SDL_EventType]] for details
|}

== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
You can add your code example here
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
This will unconditionally remove any events from the queue that match '''type'''. If you need to remove a range of event types, use [[SDL_FlushEvents]]() instead.

It's also normal to just ignore events you don't care about in your event loop without calling this function.

This function only affects currently queued events. If you want to make sure that all pending OS events are flushed, you can call [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() on the main thread immediately before the flush call.
