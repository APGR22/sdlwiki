|-
|SDL_JoystickID
|'''which'''
|the instance id of the joystick that reported the event
|-
|Uint8
|'''ball'''
|the index of the trackball that changed

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_JoyBallEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_JOYBALLMOTION is reported.  You would access it through the event's <code>jball</code> field.

An SDL_JOYBALLMOTION event occurs when a user moves a trackball on the joystick.

Trackballs only return relative motion. This is the change in position of the ball since it was last polled (last cycle of the event loop).
