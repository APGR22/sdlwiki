|-
|Uint8
|'''ball'''
|the index of the trackball that changed
|-
|int
|'''xrel'''
|the relative motion in the X direction
|-
|int
|'''yrel'''

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_JoyBallEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] structure and is used when an event of type SDL_JOYBALLMOTION is reported.

An SDL_JOYBALLMOTION event occurs when a user moves a trackball on the joystick.

Trackballs only return relative motion. This is the change in position of the ball since it was last polled (last cycle of the event loop).
