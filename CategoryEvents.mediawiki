== Introduction ==
Event handling allows your application to receive input from the user. Event handling is initialized (along with video) with a call to:

 ```
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
```
 (''see'' [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/CategoryInit Initialization & Shutdown] and [[SDL_Init]]() ''for details'')

Internally, SDL stores all the events waiting to be handled in an event queue. Using functions like [[SDL_PollEvent]](), [[SDL_PeepEvents]]() and [[SDL_WaitEvent]]() you can observe and handle waiting input events.

The key to event handling in SDL is the SDL_Event union. The event queue itself is composed of a series of SDL_Event unions, one for each waiting event. SDL_Event unions are read from the queue with the [[SDL_PollEvent]]() function and it is then up to the application to process the information stored with them.
