'''Include File(s):'''  [http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_events.h SDL_events.h]


== Introduction ==
Event handling allows your application to receive input from the user. Event handling is initialized (along with video) with a call to:

 ```
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
```
 (''see'' [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/CategoryInit Initialization & Shutdown] and [[SDL_Init]]() ''for details'')

Internally, SDL stores all the events waiting to be handled in an event queue.  Using functions like [[SDL_PollEvent]](), [[SDL_PeepEvents]]() and [[SDL_WaitEvent]]() you can observe and handle waiting input events.

The event queue itself is composed of a series of [[SDL_Event]] structures, one for each waiting event. [[SDL_Event]] structures are read from the queue with the [[SDL_PollEvent]]() function and it is then up to the application to process the information stored with them.
