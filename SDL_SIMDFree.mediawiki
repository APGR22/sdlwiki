= SDL_SIMDFree =

Deallocate memory obtained from [[SDL_SIMDAlloc]] 

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SIMDFree(void *ptr);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''ptr'''
|The pointer, returned from [[SDL_SIMDAlloc]] or [[SDL_SIMDRealloc]], to deallocate. NULL is a legal no-op.
|}

== Remarks ==

It is not valid to use this function on a pointer from anything but
[[SDL_SIMDAlloc]]() or [[SDL_SIMDRealloc]](). It can't be used on pointers
from malloc, realloc, [[SDL_malloc]], memalign, new[], etc.

However, [[SDL_SIMDFree]](NULL) is a legal no-op.

The memory pointed to by <code>ptr</code> is no longer valid for access
upon return, and may be returned to the system or reused by a future
allocation. The pointer passed to this function is no longer safe to
dereference once this function returns, and should be discarded.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.10.
