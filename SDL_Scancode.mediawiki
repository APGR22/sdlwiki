= SDL_Scancode =
An enumeration of the SDL keyboard scancode representation.


== Values ==
<<Include(SDL_ScancodeAndKeycode, , , from="##Start include here.", to="##End include here.")>>

== Code Examples ==
```c++
  //checks if a key is being remapped and prints what the remapping is
  if(event->key.keysym.scancode != SDL_GetScancodeFromKey(event->key.keysym.sym))
    printf("Physical %s key acting as %s key",
      SDL_GetScancodeName(event->key.keysym.scancode),
      SDL_GetKeyName(event->key.keysym.sym));
```

== Remarks ==
^Values of this type are used to represent the physical location of a keyboard key on the keyboard.  This is correlated to the [[SDL_Keycode]] associated with that location to give a key press meaning.^

^These are used in many places, including ^,,Values of this type are used to represent keyboard keys, among other places ,,in the <code>SDL_keysym::scancode</code> <code>key.keysym.scancode</code> field of the [[SDL_Event]] structure.

The values in this enumeration are based on the USB usage page standard:
 [http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/]

To look up a scancode or keycode by decimal or hexadecimal value you can use the following tables:
:[[SDLScancodeLookup|SDL Scancode Lookup Table]]
:[[SDLKeycodeLookup|SDL Keycode Lookup Table]]
