= SDL_PixelFormatEnumToMasks =
Use this function to convert one of the enumerated pixel formats to a bpp value and RGBA masks.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_bool SDL_PixelFormatEnumToMasks(Uint32  format,
                                    int*    bpp,
                                    Uint32* Rmask,
                                    Uint32* Gmask,
                                    Uint32* Bmask,
                                    Uint32* Amask)		
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''format'''
|an enumerated pixel format
|-
|'''bpp'''
|a bits per pixel value; usually 15, 16, or 32
|-
|'''Rmask'''
|a pointer to a value that will be filled in with the mask for the red component of the pixel
|-
|'''Gmask'''
|a pointer to a value that will be filled in with the mask for the green component of the pixel
|-
|'''Bmask'''
|a pointer to a value that will be filled in with the mask for the blue component of the pixel
|-
|'''Amask'''
|a pointer to a value that will be filled in with the mask for the alpha component of the pixel
|}

== Return Value ==
SDL_TRUE, or SDL_FALSE if the conversion wasn't possible; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.
