= SDL_SemWaitTimeout =
Use this function wait until a semaphore has a positive value and then decrements it.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SemWaitTimeout(SDL_sem* sem,
                       Uint32   ms)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''sem'''
|the semaphore to wait on
|-
|'''ms'''
|the length of the timeout in milliseconds
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 if the wait succeeds, SDL_MUTEX_TIMEDOUT if the wait does not succeed in the allotted time, or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
<<Include(SDL_CreateSemaphore, , , from="## Begin Semaphore Example", to="## End Semaphore Example")>>

== Remarks ==
This function suspends the calling thread until either the semaphore pointed to by '''sem''' has a positive value, the call is interrupted by a signal or error, or the specified time has elapsed. If the call is successful it will atomically decrement the semaphore value.
