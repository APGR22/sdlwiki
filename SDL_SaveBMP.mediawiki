= SDL_SaveBMP =
Use this function to save a surface to a BMP file.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SaveBMP(SDL_Surface* surface,
                const char*  file)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure containing the image to be saved
|-
|'''file'''
|the file to be saved to
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++

    ...

    SDL_Surface *sfc = ...

    ...
  
    if(SDL_SaveBMP(sfc, "somefile.bmp") != 0)
    {
        // Error saving bitmap
        printf("SDL_SaveBMP failed: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
    }
```

== Remarks ==
Surfaces with a 24-bit, 32-bit and paletted 8-bit format get saved in the BMP directly.  Other RGB formats with 8-bit or higher get converted to a 24-bit surface or, if they have an alpha mask or a colorkey, to a 32-bit surface before they are saved.  YUV and paletted 1-bit and 4-bit formats are not supported.
