== Remarks ==
Surfaces with a 24-bit, 32-bit and paletted 8-bit format get saved in the BMP directly.  Other RGB formats with 8-bit or higher get converted to a 24-bit surface or, if they have an alpha mask or a colorkey, to a 32-bit surface before they are saved.  YUV and paletted 1-bit and 4-bit formats are not supported.
