= SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval =
Use this function to set the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(int interval)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''interval'''
|0 for immediate updates, 1 for updates synchronized with the vertical retrace, -1 for late swap tearing; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]]
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or -1 if setting the swap interval is not supported; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
Some systems allow specifying -1 for the interval, to enable late swap tearing. Late swap tearing works the same as vsync, but if you've already missed the vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps buffers immediately, which might be less jarring for the user during occasional framerate drops. If application requests late swap tearing and the system does not support it, this function will fail and return -1. In such a case, you should probably retry the call with 1 for the interval.

Late swap tearing is implemented for some glX drivers with [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/glx_swap_control_tear.txt GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear] and for some Windows drivers with [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/wgl_swap_control_tear.txt WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear].

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
