= SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval =
Use this function to set the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(int interval)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''interval'''
|0 for immediate updates, 1 for updates synchronized with the vertical retrace, -1 for late swap tearing; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]]
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or -1 if setting the swap interval is not supported; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++

```

== Remarks ==
Some systems can specify -1 for the interval, which uses late swap tearing. That is to say, it works like specifying a 1, but if you've already missed the vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps immediately, which for small drops in framerate might be less distracting. If the system can't support late swap tearing, this function will fail. In such a case, you should probably retry the call with 1 for the interval.

Late swap tearing is implemented for some glX drivers with [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/glx_swap_control_tear.txt GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear] and for some Windows drivers with [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/wgl_swap_control_tear.txt WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear].
