= SDL_RenderCopyExF =

Copy a portion of the source texture to the current rendering target, with rotation and flipping, at subpixel precision.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_RenderCopyExF(SDL_Renderer * renderer,
                    SDL_Texture * texture,
                    const SDL_Rect * srcrect,
                    const SDL_FRect * dstrect,
                    const double angle,
                    const SDL_FPoint *center,
                    const SDL_RendererFlip flip);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|The renderer which should copy parts of a texture.
|-
|'''texture'''
|The source texture.
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|A pointer to the source rectangle, or NULL for the entire texture.
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|A pointer to the destination rectangle, or NULL for the entire rendering target.
|-
|'''angle'''
|An angle in degrees that indicates the rotation that will be applied to dstrect, rotating it in a clockwise direction
|-
|'''center'''
|A pointer to a point indicating the point around which dstrect will be rotated (if NULL, rotation will be done around dstrect.w/2, dstrect.h/2).
|-
|'''flip'''
|An [[SDL_RendererFlip]] value stating which flipping actions should be performed on the texture
|}

== Return Value ==

Return 0 on success, or -1 on error

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
