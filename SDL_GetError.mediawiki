= SDL_GetError =
Use this function to retrieve a message about the last error that occurred.


== Syntax ==
```c++
const char* SDL_GetError(void)
```

== Return Value ==
Returns a message with information about the specific error that occurred, or an empty string if there hasn't been an error message set since the last call to [[SDL_ClearError]](). <!-- Without calling [[SDL_ClearError]](), the --> The message is only applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error.  You must check the return values of SDL function calls to determine when to appropriately call [[SDL_GetError]]().

== Code Examples ==
```c++
if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) < 0) {
    // Unrecoverable error, exit here.
    printf("SDL_Init failed: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
}
```
Note: Although this example uses [[SDL_Init]](), [[SDL_GetError]]() provides an error message for any failed SDL operation which supports error reporting, see the wiki page for each particular SDL function.

== Remarks ==
It is possible for multiple errors to occur before calling [[SDL_GetError]]().  Only the last error is returned.

The returned string is statically allocated and must not be freed by the application.
