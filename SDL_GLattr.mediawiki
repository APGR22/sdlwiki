== Remarks ==
<span id="multisample"></span> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing Multisample anti-aliasing] is a type of full screen anti-aliasing.  Multipsample anti-aliasing defaults to off but can be turned on by setting SDL<code></code>_GL<code></code>_MULTISAMPLEBUFFERS to 1 and SDL_<code></code>GL_<code></code>MULTISAMPLESAMPLES to a value greater than 0.
