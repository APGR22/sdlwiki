= SDL_SetWindowGammaRamp =
Use this function to set the gamma ramp for a window.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetWindowGammaRamp(SDL_Window*   window,
                           const Uint16* red,
                           const Uint16* green,
                           const Uint16* blue)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window to change
|-
|'''red'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the red channel, or NULL
|-
|'''green'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the green channel, or NULL
|-
|'''blue'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the blue channel, or NULL
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
Set the gamma translation table for the red, green, and blue channels of the video hardware.  Each table is an array of 256 16-bit quantities, representing a mapping between the input and output for that channel.  The input is the index into the array, and the output is the 16-bit gamma value at that index, scaled to the output color precision.
