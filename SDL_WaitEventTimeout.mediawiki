= SDL_WaitEventTimeout =
Use this function to wait until the specified timeout (in milliseconds) for the next available event.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_WaitEventTimeout(SDL_Event* event,
                         int        timeout)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''event'''
|the [[SDL_Event]] structure to be filled in with the next event from the queue, or NULL
|-
|'''timeout'''
|the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for the next available event
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 1 on success or 0 if there was an error while waiting for events; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information. This also returns 0 if the timeout elapsed without an event arriving.

== Code Examples ==
```c++

```

== Remarks ==
If '''event''' is not NULL, the next event is removed from the queue and stored in the SDL_Event structure pointed to by '''event'''.

As this function implicitly calls [[SDL_PumpEvents]](), you can only call this function in the thread that set the video mode.

As of SDL 2.0, this function does not put the application's process to sleep waiting for events; it polls for events in a loop internally. This may change in the future to improve power savings.
