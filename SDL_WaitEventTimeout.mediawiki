= SDL_WaitEventTimeout =
Use this function to wait until the specified timeout (in milliseconds) for the next available event.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_WaitEventTimeout(SDL_Event* event,
                         int        timeout)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''event'''
|the [[SDL_Event]] structure to be filled in with the next event from the queue, or NULL
|-
|'''timeout'''
|the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for the next available event
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 1 on success or 0 if there was an error while waiting for events; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information. This also returns 0 if the timeout elapsed without an event arriving.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If '''event''' is not NULL, the next event is removed from the queue and stored in the SDL_Event structure pointed to by '''event'''.

As this function implicitly calls [[SDL_PumpEvents]](), you can only call this function in the thread that initialized the video subsystem.
