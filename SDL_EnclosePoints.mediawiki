= SDL_EnclosePoints =
Use this function to calculate a minimal rectangle enclosing a set of points.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_bool SDL_EnclosePoints(const SDL_Point* points,
                           int              count,
                           const SDL_Rect*  clip,
                           SDL_Rect*        result)
```

== Function Parameters ==

|'''points'''
|a pointer to an array of [[SDL_Point]] structures to be enclosed
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of points
|-
|'''clip'''
|an optional [[SDL_Rect]]; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''result'''
|a pointer to an [[SDL_Rect]] to be filled in
|}
<br/>
