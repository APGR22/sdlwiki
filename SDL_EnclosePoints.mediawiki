= SDL_EnclosePoints =
Use this function to calculate a minimal rectangle enclosing a set of points.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_bool SDL_EnclosePoints(const SDL_Point* points,
                           int              count,
                           const SDL_Rect*  clip,
                           SDL_Rect*        result)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''points'''
|an array of [[SDL_Point]] structures representing points to be enclosed
|-
|'''count'''
|the number of structures in the '''points''' array
|-
|'''clip'''
|an [[SDL_Rect]] structure used for clipping or NULL to enclose all points; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''result'''
|an [[SDL_Rect]] structure filled in with the minimal enclosing rectangle
|}


== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_TRUE if any points were enclosed or SDL_FALSE if all the points were outside of the clipping rectangle.

== Code Examples ==
