= SDL_GetNumAudioDevices =
Use this function to return the number of built in audio devices.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GetNumAudioDevices(int iscapture)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''iscapture'''
|non-0 to specify a device that has recording capability
|}

== Return Value ==
The number of available devices exposed by the current driver or -1 if an explicit list of devices can't be determined. 

== Code Examples ==
```c++
int i, count = SDL_GetNumAudioDevices(0);

for ( i = 0; i < count; ++i ) {
    printf("Audio device %d: %s\n", i, SDL_GetAudioDeviceName(i, 0));
}
```

== Remarks ==
This function is only valid after successfully initializing the audio subsystem.

Returning -1 is not an error. For example, if SDL is set up to talk to a remote audio server, it can't list every one available on the Internet, but it will still allow a specific host to be specified in [[SDL_OpenAudioDevice]]().

In many common cases, when this function returns a value <= 0, it can still successfully open the default device (NULL for first argument of  [[SDL_OpenAudioDevice]]()).
