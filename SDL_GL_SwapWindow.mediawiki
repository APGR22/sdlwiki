= SDL_GL_SwapWindow =

Update a window with OpenGL rendering.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_GL_SwapWindow(SDL_Window * window);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window to change
|}

== Remarks ==

This is used with double-buffered OpenGL contexts, which are the default.

On macOS, make sure you bind 0 to the draw framebuffer before swapping the
window, otherwise nothing will happen. If you aren't using
glBindFramebuffer(), this is the default and you won't have to do anything
extra.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>

SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("SDL2/OpenGL Demo", 30, 30, 640, 480, SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL|SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
      
/* Create an OpenGL context associated with the window. */
SDL_GLContext glcontext = SDL_GL_CreateContext(window);

/* This makes our buffer swap syncronized with the monitor's vertical refresh */
SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(1);

/* Clear context */
glClearColor(0,0,0,1);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

/* <Extra drawing functions here> */ 

/* Swap our buffer to display the current contents of buffer on screen */ 
SDL_GL_SwapWindow(window);
