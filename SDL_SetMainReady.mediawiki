= SDL_SetMainReady =
Use this function to circumvent failure of [[SDL_Init]]() when not using SDL_main() as an entry point.

<!-- #Replace SDL_Function with the name of the function and ****** with a short description of the function according to the Style Guide, then delete this comment. -->

== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_SetMainReady(void)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
#define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED
#include "SDL.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    SDL_SetMainReady();
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

    ...

    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}
</syntaxhighlight>
== Remarks ==
This function is defined in SDL_main.h, along with the preprocessor rule to redefine main() as SDL_main().  Thus to ensure that your main() function will not be changed it is necessary to define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED before including SDL.h.
