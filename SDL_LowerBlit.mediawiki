= SDL_LowerBlit =
Use this function to perform low-level surface blitting only.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_LowerBlit(SDL_Surface* src,
                  SDL_Rect*    srcrect,
                  SDL_Surface* dst,
                  SDL_Rect*    dstrect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''src'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to be copied from
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle to be copied, or NULL to copy the entire surface
|-
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the blit target
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle that is copied into
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++

== Remarks ==
This is a semi-private blit function and it performs low-level surface blitting, assuming the input rectangles have already been clipped.
