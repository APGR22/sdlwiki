== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_LowerBlit(SDL_Surface* src,
                  SDL_Rect*    srcrect,
                  SDL_Surface* dst,
                  SDL_Rect*    dstrect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''src'''
|a pointer to the source surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing '''srcrect'''
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|a pointer to the source rectangle / [[SDL_Rect]] to be queried
|-
|'''dst'''
|a pointer to the destination surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing '''dstrect'''
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|a pointer to the destination rectangle / [[SDL_Rect]] to be filled
|}

== Return Value ==
If the blit is successful it returns 0, otherwise it returns -1 on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.
