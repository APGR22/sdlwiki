= Style Guide: Code Examples =
All [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#api API pages] in this wiki contain a section for code examples.  This guide provides instructions for adding your own content to the Code Examples section of these pages.

== General Guidelines ==
'''The Code Examples section should provide simple examples of real-world applications of the API.'''

Please post code examples showing how you have used the API that may benefit other users.  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.

* Code examples should have adequate comments to make them clear and useful.

* Please remember to keep it simple and easy to understand.

For assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide.
