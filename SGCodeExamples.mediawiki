'''DRAFT'''

= Style Guide: Code Examples =
All [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#api API pages] in this wiki contain a section for Code Examples.  This guide provides instructions for adding your own content to the Code Examples section of these pages.


<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
'''The Code Examples section should provide simple examples of real-world applications of the API.'''

Please post code examples showing how you have used the API that may benefit other users.  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.

* Code examples should have adequate comments to make them clear and useful.

* Please remember to keep it simple and easy to understand.

For assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup please see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide.


== Adding the First Code Example ==
If there are no Code Examples in the section please replace the following with your code:
 ```You can add your code example here```

* Do not change or remove any of the markup immediately above or below that line.


== Adding Additional Code Examples ==

If there are existing examples in the section please add a new code box to the end of the examples section, or add your code to the end of a related group if there are many examples of various types.
* To add a new code box insert the following into the spot where your example will be located:
  ```{
{{{#!highlight cpp
 
```
}}}}
: ''Example'': [[SDL_Init]]()
* All content should be added within this markup (on the blank line with the markup above and below your example content).
