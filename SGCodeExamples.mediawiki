= Style Guide: Code Examples =
All [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#api API pages] in this wiki contain a section for code examples.  This guide provides instructions for adding your own content to the Code Examples section of these pages.


<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
''The Code Examples section should provide simple examples of real-world applications of the API.''

'''Please post code examples showing how you have used the API that may benefit other users.  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.
* Code examples should have adequate comments to make them clear and useful.
* Please remember to keep it simple and easy to understand.'''

== Adding Your Code Examples ==
 1. Begin by going to the page you wish to edit and selecting <<Color2(blue,Edit (Text))>> or <<Color2(blue,Edit (GUI))>> in the left column to begin editing.
  ~-Reminder: Markup info provided here is specifically for use in the Text editor but should work in both.-~
 1. Scroll down in the edit window to the section that begins with ```== Code Examples ==```.  Add your content below this heading following the conventions in this style guide.
 1. Find information relevant to your content in the style guide sections [[#formatting|below]] and apply the appropriate formatting as you create your content.
 1. Preview your work as you go by clicking <<Color2(blue,Preview)>> in the left column.
