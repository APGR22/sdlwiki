= SDL_DollarGestureEvent =
A structure that contains complex gesture event information.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|SDL_DOLLARGESTURE or SDL_DOLLARRECORD
|-
|Uint32
|'''timestamp'''
|timestamp of the event
|-
|SDL_TouchID
|'''touchId'''
|the touch device id
|-
|SDL_GestureID
|'''gestureId'''
|the unique id of the closest gesture to the performed stroke
|-
|Uint32
|'''numFingers'''
|the number of fingers used to draw the stroke
|-
|float
|'''error'''
|the difference between the gesture template and the actual performed gesture (lower error is a better match)
|-
|float
|'''x'''
|the normalized center of gesture
|-
|float
|'''y'''
|the normalized center of gesture
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++

```

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_DollarGestureEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_DOLLARGESTURE is reported.  You would access it through the event's <code>dgesture</code> field.

'''x''' and '''y''' are in range 0 to 1.

For SDL_DOLLARRECORD only '''touchId''' and '''gestureId''' are valid.
