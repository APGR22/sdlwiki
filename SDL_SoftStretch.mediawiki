= SDL_SoftStretch =
Use this function to perform a fast, low quality, stretch blit between two surfaces of the same pixel format.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SoftStretch(SDL_Surface*    src,
                    const SDL_Rect* srcrect,
                    SDL_Surface*    dst,
                    const SDL_Rect* dstrect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''src'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to be copied from
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle to be copied, or NULL to copy the entire surface
|-
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the blit target
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle that is copied into, or NULL to copy into the entire surface
