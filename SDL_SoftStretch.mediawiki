= SDL_SoftStretch =
Use this function to perform a fast, low quality, stretch blit between two surfaces of the same pixel format.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SoftStretch(SDL_Surface*    src,
                    const SDL_Rect* srcrect,
                    SDL_Surface*    dst,
                    const SDL_Rect* dstrect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
<<Color2(green,How is const SDL_Rect* different from SDL_Rect*?)>>
{|
|'''src'''
|a pointer to the source surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing '''srcrect'''
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|a pointer to the source rectangle / [[SDL_Rect]] to be queried
|-
|'''dst'''
|a pointer to the destination surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing '''dstrect'''
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|a pointer to the destination rectangle / [[SDL_Rect]] to be filled
|}
