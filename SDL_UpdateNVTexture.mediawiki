====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_UpdateNVTexture =

Update a rectangle within a planar NV12 or NV21 texture with new pixels.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_UpdateNVTexture(SDL_Texture * texture,
                         const SDL_Rect * rect,
                         const Uint8 *Yplane, int Ypitch,
                         const Uint8 *UVplane, int UVpitch);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to update
|-
|'''rect'''
|a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or NULL to update the entire texture.
|-
|'''Yplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the Y plane.
|-
|'''Ypitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane.
|-
|'''UVplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the UV plane.
|-
|'''UVpitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the UV plane.
|}

== Return Value ==

Return 0 on success, or -1 if the texture is not valid.

== Remarks ==

You can use [[SDL_UpdateTexture]]() as long as your pixel data is a
contiguous block of NV12/21 planes in the proper order, but this function
is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.16.
