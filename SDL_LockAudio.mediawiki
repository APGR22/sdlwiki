Use this function to lock out the callback function.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_LockAudio(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The lock manipulated by these functions protects the callback function.  During a SDL_LockAudio()/[[SDL_UnlockAudio]]() pair, you can be guaranteed that the callback function is not running.  

Do not call these from the callback function or you will cause deadlock.
