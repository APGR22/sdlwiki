= SDL_LockAudio =
This function is a legacy means of locking the audio device. New programs might want to use [[SDL_LockAudioDevice]]() instead.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_LockAudio(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
void MyAudioCallback(void *userdata, Uint8* stream, int len)
{
    printf("The audio callback is running!\n");
    SDL_memset(stream, 0, len);  // just silence.
    printf("The audio callback is done!\n");
}

// don't lock for 2 seconds at a time in real life, please.
SDL_Delay(2000);  // callback runs for 2 seconds.
SDL_LockAudio();
printf("The audio callback can't be running right now!\n");
SDL_Delay(2000);  // callback doesn't run for 2 seconds.
printf("Ok, unlocking!\n");
SDL_UnlockAudio();
SDL_Delay(2000);  // callback runs for 2 seconds.
```

== Remarks ==
This function is equivalent to calling

```c++
SDL_LockAudioDevice(1);
```

and is only useful if you used the legacy [[SDL_OpenAudio]]() function.
