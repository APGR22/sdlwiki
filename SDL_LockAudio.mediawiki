= SDL_LockAudio =
Use this function to lock out the audio callback function.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_LockAudio(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The lock manipulated by these functions protects the callback function.  During an [[SDL_LockAudio]]()/[[SDL_UnlockAudio]]() pair you can be guaranteed that the callback function for the default audio device is not running.  

[[SDL_LockAudio]]() is not a re-entrant function and can potentially block if it is called more than once from the same thread before a call to [[SDL_Unlock]]() is made.

Do not call these from the callback function or you will cause deadlock.
