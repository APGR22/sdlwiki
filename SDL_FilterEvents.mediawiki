The function prototype for '''filter''' is:

int SDL_EventFilter(void*      userdata,
                    SDL_Event* event)
```
: where its parameters are:
 ||<code>userdata</code>||what was passed as '''userdata''' to [[SDL_FilterEvents]]()||
 ||<code>event</code>||the desired event to pull from the queue||

See [[SDL_SetEventFilter]]() for more information. Unlike [[SDL_SetEventFilter]](), this function does not change the filter permanently, it only uses the supplied filter until this function returns.
