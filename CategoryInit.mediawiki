== Introduction ==

Functions in this category are used to set up SDL 1.3 for use and generally have global effects in your program.

=== Introduction to Initialization ===

To begin using SDL in your program [[SDL_Init]]() must be called to initialize subsystems and enable use of other SDL functions. 
 {i} The [[CategoryEvents|Event Handling]], [[CategoryIO|File I/O]], and [[CategoryThread|Threading]] subsystems are initialized by default.  To initialize other subsystems you must specifically call them.  Multiple subsystems may be OR'd together. 
: ''Example:''
: ```
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO|SDL_INIT_AUDIO);
```
: Initializes the 3 default subsystems plus the [[CategoryVideo|Video]] and [[CategoryAudio|Audio]] subsystems.

=== Introduction to Shut Down ===

[[SDL_Quit]]() should be called before an SDL application exits to shut down all subsystems, including the default ones.
* It is not necessary to specify individual subsystems when using [[SDL_Quit]]().  It will automatically shut down all active subsystems.
