= SDL_SwapFloatBE =
Use this function to swap byte order from big-endian to native.


== Syntax ==
```c++
float SDL_SwapFloatBE(float x)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''x'''
|the data to be swapped
|}

== Return Value ==
The data in a native format the compiler will accept. ???

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
''You can add useful comments here''

???  This is mainly to keep compilers from complaining in SDL code.  If there is no real 64-bit datatype, then compilers will complain about the fake 64-bit datatype that SDL provides when it compiles user code.
