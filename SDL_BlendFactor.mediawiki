= SDL_BlendFactor =
An enumeration of blend factors used when creating a custom blend mode with [[SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode]]().


== Values ==
{|
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ZERO
|0, 0, 0, 0
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE
|1, 1, 1, 1
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_SRC_COLOR
|srcR, srcG, srcB, srcA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR
|1-srcR, 1-srcG, 1-srcB, 1-srcA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_SRC_ALPHA
|srcA, srcA, srcA, srcA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA
|1-srcA, 1-srcA, 1-srcA, 1-srcA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_COLOR
|dstR, dstG, dstB, dstA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR
|1-dstR, 1-dstG, 1-dstB, 1-dstA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA
|dstA, dstA, dstA, dstA
|-
|SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA
|1-dstA, 1-dstA, 1-dstA, 1-dstA
|}

== Remarks ==

The blend factors are multiplied with the pixels from a drawing operation (src) and the pixels from the render target (dst) before the blend operation. The comma-separated factors listed above are always applied in the component order red, green, blue, and alpha.

Some renderers may not support all factors. See [[SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode]]() for a list of what the current renderers support.

== Version ==

This enumeration is available since SDL 2.0.6.
