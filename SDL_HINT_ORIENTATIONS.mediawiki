= SDL_HINT_ORIENTATIONS =
A hint that specifies a variable controlling which orientations are allowed on iOS.


== Values ==
{|
|LandscapeLeft
|top of device left
|-
|LandscapeRight
|top of device right
|-
|Portrait
|top of device up
|-
|PortraitUpsideDown
|top of device down
|}


== Default ==
By default all orientations are allowed.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
#include "SDL.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_ORIENTATIONS, "LandscapeLeft LandscapeRight");
}
```

== Remarks ==
In some circumstances it is necessary to be able to explicitly control which UI orientations are allowed.

This variable is a space delimited list of the above values.

```#!wiki comment
Could this statement be reworded to be more clear esp. for non-English speakers?  Maybe - These values may be combined by using a space between them. Or - Separate multiple values by a space.
```
