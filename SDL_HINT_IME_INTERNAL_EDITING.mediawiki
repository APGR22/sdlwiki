= SDL_HINT_IME_INTERNAL_EDITING =
A hint that specifies whether certain IMEs should handle text editing internally instead of sending [[SDL_TextEditingEvent|SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events.




== Values ==
{|
|0
|[[SDL_TextEditingEvent|SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events are sent, and it is the application's responsibility to render the text from these events and differentiate it somehow from committed text. (default)
|-
|1
|If supported by the IME then [[SDL_TextEditingEvent|SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events are not sent, and text that is being composed will be rendered in its own UI.
|}


== Default ==
By default [[SDL_TextEditingEvent|SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events are sent, and it is the application's responsibility to render the text from these events and differentiate it somehow from committed text.


== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```
