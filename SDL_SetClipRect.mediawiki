= SDL_SetClipRect =
Use this function to set the clipping rectangle for the destination surface in a blit.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_bool SDL_SetClipRect(SDL_Surface*    surface,
                         const SDL_Rect* rect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|a pointer to the surface of type [[SDL_Surface]] to be updated
|-
|'''rect'''
|a pointer to a rectangle of type [[SDL_Rect]], or NULL for the entire render target
|}

== Return Value ==
If the clip rectangle doesn't intersect the surface, the function will return SDL_FALSE and blits will be completely clipped. Otherwise the function returns SDL_TRUE and blits to the surface will be clipped to the intersection of the surface area and the clipping rectangle.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If the clip rectangle is NULL, clipping will be disabled. 

Note that blits are automatically clipped to the edges of the source and destination surfaces.
