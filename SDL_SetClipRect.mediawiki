= SDL_SetClipRect =
Use this function to set the clipping rectangle for a surface.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_bool SDL_SetClipRect(SDL_Surface*    surface,
                         const SDL_Rect* rect)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to be clipped
|-
|'''rect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the clipping rectangle, or NULL to disable clipping
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_TRUE if the rectangle intersects the surface, otherwise SDL_FALSE and blits will be completely clipped.

== Remarks ==
When '''surface''' is the destination of a blit, only the area within the clip rectangle is drawn into.

Note that blits are automatically clipped to the edges of the source and destination surfaces.
