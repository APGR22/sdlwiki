= SDL_RWseek =
Use this function to seek within an SDL_RWops data stream.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Sint64 SDL_RWseek(SDL_RWops* context,
                  Sint64     offset, 
                  int        whence)
```

<<Color2(green,Seems like the type for '''context''' might have changed from SDL_RWops* to struct SDL_RWops*.  Which is correct?)>>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''context'''
|^a data stream containing the seek function???^
|-
|'''offset'''
|an offset in bytes, relative to '''whence''' location; can be negative
|-
|'''whence'''
|any of RW_SEEK_SET, RW_SEEK_CUR, RW_SEEK_END; see [[#whence|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns the final offset in the data stream after the seek or -1 on error.

== Code Examples ==
*<br/>
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "SDL_rwops.h"

int main()
{
  Sint64 length;
  SDL_RWops *rw=SDL_RWFromFile("myfile.bin","rb");
  if(rw==NULL)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"Couldn't open myfile.bin\n");
    return(1);
  }

  /* Seek to 0 bytes from the end of the file -- i.e. the exact end of file */
  length=SDL_RWseek(rw,0,SEEK_END);
  SDL_RWclose(rw);
  if(length<0)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"Could not seek inside myfile.bin\n");
    return(2);
  }

  fprintf(stderr,"myfile.bin is %d bytes long\n",length);
  return(0);
}
```<<BR>>*

== Remarks ==
*<br/>This is not a predefined function, just a macro that calls whatever seek function has been placed in the SDL_RWops structure.<br/>*

[[SDL_RWseek]] seeks to '''offset''' relative to '''whence'''. <<Color2(green,Should SDL_RWseek have () like a function even though it's a macro?)>>

<span id="whence"></span>'''whence''' may be any of the following values:
{|
|RW_SEEK_SET
|seek from the beginning of data
|-
|RW_SEEK_CUR
|seek relative to current read point
|-
|RW_SEEK_END
|seek relative to the end of data
|}
