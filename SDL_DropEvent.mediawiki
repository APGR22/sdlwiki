= SDL_DropEvent =
A structure that contains an event used to request a file open by the system.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|the event type; SDL_DROPFILE
|-
|Uint32
|'''timestamp'''
|timestamp of the event
|-
|char*
|'''file'''
|the file name, which should be freed with SDL_free()
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
// Example program:
// SDL_DropEvent usage

#include "SDL.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);               //  SDL2 Initialization
    
    SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow(  //  Create a window
        "SDL_DropEvent usage, please drop the file on window",
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        640,
        480,
        SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL
    );

    // Check that the window was successfully made
    if (window == NULL) {
        // In the event that the window could not be made...
        printf("Could not create window: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
        return 1;
    }
    
    SDL_Event event;                        //  Define event handle
    char* droped_filedir;                   //  Pointer for directory of droped file
    
    for(;;) {                               //  Program loop
        while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
            switch (event.type) {
              case (SDL_QUIT): {            //  In case of Exit
                return 0;
              }

              case (SDL_DROPFILE): {        //  In case if Droped file
                droped_filedir = event.drop.file;
                //  Shows directory of droped file
                SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox(
                    SDL_MESSAGEBOX_INFORMATION,
                   "File droped on window",
                   droped_filedir,
                  window
                );
                SDL_free(droped_filedir);    //  Free droped_filedir memory
                break;
              }
            }
        }
        SDL_Delay(0);
    }
    
    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);        //  Close and destroy the window
    
    SDL_Quit();                       //  Clean up
    return 0;
}
```

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_DropEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_DROPFILE is reported. You would access it through the event's <code>drop</code> field.

This event is disabled by default.  You can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]().  

If you enable this event you must free the filename in the event.

=== Mac OSX ===
To enable drag&drop on your SDL app, you must ''also'' edit your info.plist file. Add/Modify '''Document Types.''' For example, to enable all document types, add the "public.data" mime type as a document type.
