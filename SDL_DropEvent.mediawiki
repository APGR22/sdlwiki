= SDL_DropEvent =
A structure that contains an event used to request a file open by the system.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|the event type; SDL_DROPFILE
|-
|Uint32
|'''timestamp'''
|timestamp of the event
|-
|char*
|'''file'''
|the file name, which should be freed with [[SDL_free]]()
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
// Example program:
// SDL_DropEvent usage

#include "SDL.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    SDL_Window *window;
    SDL_Event event;                        //  Declare event handle
    char* dropped_filedir;                  //  Pointer for directory of dropped file

    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);               //  SDL2 initialization

    window = SDL_CreateWindow(  //  Create a window
        "SDL_DropEvent usage, please drop the file on window",
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        640,
        480,
        SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL
    );

    // Check that the window was successfully made
    if (window == NULL) {
        // In the event that the window could not be made...
        printf("Could not create window: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
        return 1;
    }

    for(;;) {                               //  Program loop
        while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
            switch (event.type) {
                case (SDL_QUIT): {          //  In case of exit
                    return 0;               //  This skips the clean up
                }

                case (SDL_DROPFILE): {      //  In case if dropped file
                    dropped_filedir = event.drop.file;
                    //  Shows directory of dropped file
                    SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox(
                        SDL_MESSAGEBOX_INFORMATION,
                        "File dropped on window",
                        dropped_filedir,
                        window
                    );
                    SDL_free(dropped_filedir);    //  Free dropped_filedir memory
                    break;
               }
            }
        }
        SDL_Delay(0);
    }

    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);        //  Close and destroy the window

    SDL_Quit();                       //  Clean up
    return 0;
}
```

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_DropEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_DROPFILE is reported. You would access it through the event's <code>drop</code> field.

This event is disabled by default.  You can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]().  

If you enable this event you must free the filename in the event.

=== Mac OS X ===
To enable drag&drop on your SDL app, you must ''also'' edit your info.plist file. Add/Modify '''Document Types.''' For example, to enable all document types, add the "public.data" mime type as a document type.
