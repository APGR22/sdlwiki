[[SDL_DropEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_DROPFILE is reported. You would access it through the event's <code>drop</code> field.

This event is disabled by default.  You can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]().  

If you enable this event you must free the filename in the event.

=== Mac OSX ===
To enable drag&drop on your SDL app, you must ''also'' edit your info.plist file. Add/Modify '''Document Types.''' For example, to enable all document types, add the "public.data" mime type as a document type.
