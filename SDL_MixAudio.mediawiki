= SDL_MixAudio =
Use this function to mix audio data.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_MixAudio(Uint8*       dst, 
                  const Uint8* src,
                  Uint32       len, 
                  int          volume)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|the destination for the mixed audio
|-
|'''src'''
|the source audio buffer to be mixed
|-
|'''len'''
|,,defines ,,the length of the audio buffer in bytes
|-
|'''volume'''
|ranges from 0 - 128, and should be set to SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME for full audio volume
|}

== Remarks ==
This takes an audio buffer '''src''' of '''len''' bytes in the playing audio format and mixes it into '''dst''', performing addition, volume adjustment, and overflow clipping.

Note that this does not change hardware volume.

This is provided for convenience -- you can mix your own audio data.

Do not use this function for mixing together more than two streams of sample data. The output from repeated application of this function may be distorted by clipping, because there is no accumulator with greater range than the input (not to mention this being an inefficient way of doing it). Use mixing functions from SDL_mixer, OpenAL, or write your own mixer instead.

It is a common misconception that this function is required to write audio data to an output stream in the audio-callback.  While you can do that, [[SDL_MixAudio]]() is really only needed when you're mixing a single audio stream with a volume adjustment.

*<br/><<Color2(green,The following example is in the old wiki between "in the audio-callback." and "While you can do that".  Should it be included here or is it unnecessary?)>>
```
void audio_callback(void *udata, Uint8 *stream, int len)
{
    SDL_MixAudio(stream, audio_pos, len, SDL_MIX_MAXVOLUME);
}
