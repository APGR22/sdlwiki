= SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode =

Set relative mouse mode.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_bool enabled);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''enabled'''
|[[SDL_TRUE]] to enable relative mode, [[SDL_FALSE]] to disable.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

While the mouse is in relative mode, the cursor is hidden, and the driver
will try to report continuous motion in the current window. Only relative
motion events will be delivered, the mouse position will not change.

This function will flush any pending mouse motion.
