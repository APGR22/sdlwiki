== Why does SDL disable my screensaver by default? ==
Many applications using SDL are games or screensavers or media players where the user is either watching something for an extended period of time or using joystick input which generally does not prevent the screensaver from kicking on.

You can disable this behavior by setting the environment variable:
SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER=1
This can be set globally for the user or on a per-application basis in code.
