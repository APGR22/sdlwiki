= SDL_FillRect =
Use this function to perform a fast fill of ,,the given,, ^a^ rectangle with ^a specific^ color.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_FillRect(SDL_Surface*    dst,
                 const SDL_Rect* rect,
                 Uint32          color)
```

<<Color2(green,Why is this a ''const'' SDL_Rect?  Doesn't it have to be written to with the new fill?  Or does a new filled Rect end up on the surface w/o changing the old one?)>>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|the destination [[SDL_Surface]] structure
|-
|'''rect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure to fill^, or NULL to fill the entire render target^; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''color'''
|the color to fill the rectangle with; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If '''rect''' is NULL, the whole surface will be filled with color.  <<Color2(green,Move this up into the param as above?)>>

,,The,, '''color''' should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be generated by the [[SDL_MapRGB]]() *or [[SDL_MapRGBA]]()*function^s^.  *If the color value contains an alpha value then the destination is simply "filled" with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via [[SDL_SetClipRect]]()), then this function will clip based on the intersection of the clip rectangle and the ''',,dst,,rect''' rectangle, and the ''',,dst,,rect''' rectangle will be modified to represent the area actually filled.

<<Color2(green,I suspect that this section is now defunct.  The referenced function has no page in 1.3.)>>

If you call this on the video surface (ie: the value of SDL_GetVideoSurface()) you may have to update the video surface to see the result. This can happen if you are using a shadowed surface that is not double buffered in Windows XP using build 1.2.9. <br/>*
