= SDL_FillRect =
Use this function to perform a fast fill of a rectangle with a specific color.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_FillRect(SDL_Surface*    dst,
                 const SDL_Rect* rect,
                 Uint32          color)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the drawing target
|-
|'''rect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle to fill, or NULL to fill the entire surface
|-
|'''color'''
|the color to fill with; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_Surface *s = NULL; //Declaring the surface.

s = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, width, height, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0); //Creating the surface.
SDL_FillRect(s, NULL, SDL_MapRGB(s->format, 255, 0, 0)) //Filling the surface with red colour.
```

== Remarks ==
'''color''' should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and can be generated by [[SDL_MapRGB]]() or [[SDL_MapRGBA]]().  If the color value contains an alpha component then the destination is simply filled with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via [[SDL_SetClipRect]]()), then this function will fill based on the intersection of the clip rectangle and '''rect'''.
