====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_FillRect =

Perform a fast fill of a rectangle with a specific color.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_FillRect
    (SDL_Surface * dst, const SDL_Rect * rect, Uint32 color);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the drawing target
|-
|'''rect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle to fill, or NULL to fill the entire surface
|-
|'''color'''
|the color to fill with
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

<code>color</code> should be a pixel of the format used by the surface, and
can be generated by [[SDL_MapRGB]]() or [[SDL_MapRGBA]](). If the color
value contains an alpha component then the destination is simply filled
with that alpha information, no blending takes place.

If there is a clip rectangle set on the destination (set via
[[SDL_SetClipRect]]()), then this function will fill based on the
intersection of the clip rectangle and <code>rect</code>.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
/* Declaring the surface. */
SDL_Surface *s;

/* Creating the surface. */
s = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, width, height, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0);

/* Filling the surface with red color. */
SDL_FillRect(s, NULL, SDL_MapRGB(s->format, 255, 0, 0));
</syntaxhighlight>
