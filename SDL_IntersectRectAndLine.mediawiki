= SDL_IntersectRectAndLine =
Use this function to calculate the intersection of a rectangle and line segment.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_bool SDL_IntersectRectAndLine(const SDL_Rect* rect,
                                  int*            X1,
                                  int*            Y1,
                                  int*            X2,
                                  int*            Y2)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''rect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] to be compared
|-
|'''X1'''
|a pointer to the starting X-coordinate of the line
|-
|'''Y1'''
|a pointer to the starting Y-coordinate of the line
|-
|'''X2'''
|a pointer to the ending X-coordinate of the line
|-
|'''Y2'''
|a pointer to the ending Y-coordinate of the line
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_TRUE if there is an intersection, SDL_FALSE otherwise.

== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
This function is used to clip a line segment to a rectangle.  The end points are modified from the starting coordinates ('''X1''', '''Y1''', '''X2''', and '''Y2''') to reflect any clipping that occurs.  A line segment contained entirely within the rectangle or that does not intersect will remain unchanged.  A line segment that crosses the rectangle at either or both ends will be clipped to the boundary of the rectangle and the new coordinates passed to '''X1''', '''Y1''', '''X2''', and/or '''Y2''' as necessary.
