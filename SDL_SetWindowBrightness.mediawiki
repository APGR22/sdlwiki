====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SetWindowBrightness =

Set the brightness (gamma multiplier) for a given window's display.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetWindowBrightness(SDL_Window * window, float brightness);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window used to select the display whose brightness will be changed
|-
|'''brightness'''
|the brightness (gamma multiplier) value to set where 0.0 is completely dark and 1.0 is normal brightness
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

Despite the name and signature, this method sets the brightness of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be
owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of
this display can be retrieved using [[SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex]]().) The
brightness set will not follow the window if it is moved to another
display.

Many platforms will refuse to set the display brightness in modern times.
You are better off using a shader to adjust gamma during rendering, or
something similar.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
