Use this function to set the brightness (gamma multiplier) for the display that owns a given window.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetWindowBrightness(SDL_Window* window,
                            float       brightness)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window used to select the display whose brightness will be changed
|-
|'''brightness'''
|the brightness (gamma multiplier) value to set where 0.0 is completely dark and 1.0 is normal brightness

== Remarks ==
Despite the name and signature, this method sets the brightness of the entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display can be retrieved using [[SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex]].)
