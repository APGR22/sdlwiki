== Remarks ==
[[SDL_MouseWheelEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_MOUSEWHEEL is reported.  You would access it through the event's <code>wheel</code> field.

An SDL_MOUSEWHEEL event occurs whenever a user moves the mouse wheel.

Movements to the left generate negative '''x''' values and to the right generate positive '''x''' values.  Movements up (scroll forward) generate negative '''y''' values and down (scroll backward) generate positive '''y''' values.  <<Color2(green,This information needs to be verified.)>> <<Color2(red, The information is correct for Windows and Mac Os X.
