= SDL_UpdateYUVTexture =
Use this function to update a rectangle within a planar YV12 or IYUV texture with new pixel data.




== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_UpdateYUVTexture(SDL_Texture*    texture,
                         const SDL_Rect* rect,
                         const Uint8*    Yplane,
                         int             Ypitch,
                         const Uint8*    Uplane,
                         int             Upitch,
                         const Uint8*    Vplane,
                         int             Vpitch)
```


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to update
|-
|'''rect'''
|a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or NULL to update the entire texture
|-
|'''Yplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the Y plane
|-
|'''Ypitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane
|-
|'''Uplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the U plane
|-
|'''Upitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the U plane
|-
|'''Vplane'''
|the raw pixel data for the V plane
|-
|'''Vpitch'''
|the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the V plane
|}


== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or -1 if the texture is not valid; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==
You can use [[SDL_UpdateTexture]]() as long as your pixel data is a contiguous block of Y and U/V planes in the proper order, but this function is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
