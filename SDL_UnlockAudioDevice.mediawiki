= SDL_UnlockAudioDevice =
Use this function to unlock the audio callback function for a specified device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_UnlockAudioDevice(SDL_AudioDeviceID dev)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dev'''
|the ID of the device to be unlocked
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
Unlocks a previous [[SDL_LockAudioDevice]]() call. 

The lock manipulated by these functions protects the callback function.  During a [[SDL_LockAudioDevice]]()/[[SDL_UnlockAudioDevice]]() pair, you can be guaranteed that the callback function for that device is not running.  

Do not call these from the callback function or you will cause deadlock.
