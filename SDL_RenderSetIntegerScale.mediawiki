= SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale =

Set whether to force integer scales for resolution-independent rendering.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale(SDL_Renderer * renderer,
                              SDL_bool enable);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the renderer for which integer scaling should be set
|-
|'''enable'''
|enable or disable the integer scaling for rendering
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.



== Remarks ==

This function restricts the logical viewport to integer values - that is,
when a resolution is between two multiples of a logical size, the viewport
size is rounded down to the lower multiple.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.5.
