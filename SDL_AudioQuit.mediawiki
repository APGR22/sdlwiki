= SDL_AudioQuit =
Use this function to shut down audio if you initialized it with [[SDL_AudioInit]]().


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_AudioQuit(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
int i;

for (i = 0; i < SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers(); ++i) {
    const char* driver_name = SDL_GetAudioDriver(i);
    if (SDL_AudioInit(driver_name)) {
        printf("Audio driver failed to initialize: %s\n", driver_name);
        continue;
    }
    SDL_AudioQuit();
}
```

== Remarks ==
This function is used internally, and should not be used unless you have a specific need to specify the audio driver you want to use. You should normally use [[SDL_Quit]]() or [[SDL_QuitSubSystem]]().
