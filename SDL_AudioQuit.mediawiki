====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_AudioQuit =

Use this function to shut down audio if you initialized it with [[SDL_AudioInit]]().

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_AudioQuit(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This function is used internally, and should not be used unless you have a
specific need to specify the audio driver you want to use. You should
normally use [[SDL_Quit]]() or [[SDL_QuitSubSystem]]().

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int i;

for (i = 0; i < SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers(); ++i) {
    const char* driver_name = SDL_GetAudioDriver(i);
    if (SDL_AudioInit(driver_name)) {
        printf("Audio driver failed to initialize: %s\n", driver_name);
        continue;
    }
    SDL_AudioQuit();
}
</syntaxhighlight>
