= SDL_LowerBlitScaled =

Perform low-level surface scaled blitting only.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_LowerBlitScaled
    (SDL_Surface * src, SDL_Rect * srcrect,
    SDL_Surface * dst, SDL_Rect * dstrect);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''src'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to be copied from
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle to be copied
|-
|'''dst'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is the blit target
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure representing the rectangle that is copied into
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.



== Remarks ==

This is a semi-private function and it performs low-level surface
blitting, assuming the input rectangles have already been clipped.
