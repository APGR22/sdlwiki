= SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED =
A hint that specifies if Xinput gamepad devices are detected. Xinput is limited to 4 gamepads, if you want more than four you need to set it to "0".




== Values ==
{|
|0
|disable XInput detection (only uses direct input)
|-
|1
|enable XInput detection (the default)
|}


== Default ==
By default Xinput gamepad devices are detected.


== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED, "0");
//...
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING);
</syntaxhighlight>


== Remarks ==
You need to set this hint before you call [[SDL_Init]] otherwise it will not take effect.
