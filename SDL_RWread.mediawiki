= SDL_RWread =
Use this function to read from a data source ''-or-'' *call the function pointed to by an SDL_RWops structure's read member.*


== Syntax ==
```c++
size_t SDL_RWread(struct SDL_RWops* context,
                  void*             ptr,
                  size_t            size,
                  size_t            maxnum)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''context'''
|,,a pointer to ,,an SDL_RWops structure ^containing the read function^???
|-
|'''ptr'''
|*a pointer to an area of memory to read data into*
|-
|'''size'''
|*the size of each block of memory to read*
|-
|'''maxnum'''
|*the maximum number of memory blocks to read (it may read less)*
|}

<<Color2(green,I think '''ptr''' is an exception to the 'pointer rule'.)>>

== Return Value ==
Returns the number of objects read, or 0 at error or end of file; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

''-or-''

*Returns the number of memory blocks read, or -1 if the read failed*; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
*
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "SDL_rwops.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int blocks;
  char buf[256];
  SDL_RWops *rw=SDL_RWFromFile("file.bin","rb");
  if(rw==NULL)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"Couldn't open file.bin\n");
    return(1);
  }

  blocks=SDL_RWread(rw,buf,16,256/16);
  SDL_RWclose(rw);
  if(blocks<0)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"Couldn't read from file.bin\n");
    return(2);
  }

  fprintf(stderr,"Read %d 16-byte blocks\n",blocks);
  return(0);
}
```
*

== Remarks ==
*<br/>This is not a built in function. This is a C macro that calls whatever function happens to be in the 'read' member of the SDL_RWops structure.<br/>*

[[SDL_RWread]] reads up to '''maxnum''' objects each of size '''size''' from the data source to the area pointed at by '''ptr'''.  <<Color2(green,Should SDL_RWread have () like a function even though it's a macro?)>>
