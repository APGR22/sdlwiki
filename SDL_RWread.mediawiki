= SDL_RWread =
Use this function to read from a data source.


== Syntax ==
```c++
size_t SDL_RWread(struct SDL_RWops* context,
                  void*             ptr,
                  size_t            size,
                  size_t            maxnum)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''context'''
|a pointer to an SDL_RWops structure
|-
|'''ptr'''
|a pointer to a buffer to read data into
|-
|'''size'''
|the size of each object to read, in bytes
|-
|'''maxnum'''
|the maximum number of objects to be read
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns the number of objects read, or 0 at error or end of file; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_RWops *rw = SDL_RWFromFile("test.bin","r");
if (rw != NULL) {
  extern Uint8 buf[256];
  SDL_RWread(rw, buf, sizeof (buf));
  SDL_RWclose(rw);
}
```

== Remarks ==
This function reads up to '''maxnum''' objects each of size '''size''' from the data source to the area pointed at by '''ptr'''. This function may read less objects than requested. It will return zero when there has been an error or the data stream is completely read.

SDL_RWread is actually a macro that calls the SDL_RWops's '''read''' method appropriately, to simplify application development.
