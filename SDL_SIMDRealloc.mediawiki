= SDL_SIMDRealloc =

Reallocate memory obtained from [[SDL_SIMDAlloc]] 

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void * SDL_SIMDRealloc(void *mem, const size_t len);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''mem'''
|The pointer obtained from [[SDL_SIMDAlloc]]. This function also accepts NULL, at which point this function is the same as calling [[SDL_SIMDAlloc]] with a NULL pointer.
|-
|'''len'''
|The length, in bytes, of the block to allocated. The actual allocated block might be larger due to padding, etc. Passing 0 will return a non-NULL pointer, assuming the system isn't out of memory.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to the newly-reallocated block, NULL if out of memory.

== Remarks ==

It is not valid to use this function on a pointer from anything but
[[SDL_SIMDAlloc]](). It can't be used on pointers from malloc, realloc,
[[SDL_malloc]], memalign, new[], etc.
