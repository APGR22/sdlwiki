= SDL_HINT_WINDOW_FRAME_USABLE_WHILE_CURSOR_HIDDEN =

A variable controlling whether the window frame and title bar are interactive when the cursor is hidden

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_WINDOW_FRAME_USABLE_WHILE_CURSOR_HIDDEN    "SDL_WINDOW_FRAME_USABLE_WHILE_CURSOR_HIDDEN"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - The window frame is
not interactive when the cursor is hidden (no move, resize, etc) "1" - The
window frame is interactive when the cursor is hidden

By default SDL will allow interaction with the window frame when the cursor
is hidden

== Default ==

By default SDL will allow interaction with the window frame when the cursor is hidden.
