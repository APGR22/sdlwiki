= SDL_HINT_GRAB_KEYBOARD =

A variable controlling whether grabbing input grabs the keyboard

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_GRAB_KEYBOARD              "SDL_GRAB_KEYBOARD"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - Grab will affect
only the mouse "1" - Grab will affect mouse and keyboard

By default SDL will not grab the keyboard so system shortcuts still work.

== Default ==

By default SDL will not grab the keyboard so system shortcuts still work.
