= SDL_HINT_TIMER_RESOLUTION =

A variable that controls the timer resolution, in milliseconds.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_TIMER_RESOLUTION "SDL_TIMER_RESOLUTION"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

The higher resolution the timer, the more frequently the CPU services timer
interrupts, and the more precise delays are, but this takes up power and
CPU time. This hint is only used on Windows.

See this blog post for more information:
http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/windows-timer-resolution-megawatts-wasted/

If this variable is set to "0", the system timer resolution is not set.

The default value is "1". This hint may be set at any time.

== Default ==

By default the value is "1".
