= SDL_HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION =
A hint that specifies how 3D acceleration is used with [[SDL_GetWindowSurface]]().


== Values ==
{|
|0
|disable 3D acceleration
|-
|1
|enable 3D acceleration, using the default renderer
|-
|X
|enable 3D acceleration, using X where X is one of the valid rendering drivers.  (e.g. "direct3d", "opengl", etc.)
|}

== Default ==
By default SDL tries to make a best guess whether to use acceleration or not on each platform.

== Remarks ==
SDL can try to accelerate the screen surface returned by [[SDL_GetWindowSurface]]() by using streaming textures with a 3D rendering engine.  This variable controls whether and how this is done.
