= SDL_HINT_IME_INTERNAL_EDITING =

A variable to control whether certain IMEs should handle text editing internally instead of sending [[SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_IME_INTERNAL_EDITING "SDL_IME_INTERNAL_EDITING"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

The variable can be set to the following values: "0" - [[SDL_TEXTEDITING]]
events are sent, and it is the application's responsibility to render the
text from these events and differentiate it somehow from committed text.
(default) "1" - If supported by the IME then [[SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events are
not sent, and text that is being composed will be rendered in its own UI.

== Default ==

By default [[SDL_TextEditingEvent|SDL_TEXTEDITING]] events are sent, and it is the application's responsibility to render the text from these events and differentiate it somehow from committed text.
