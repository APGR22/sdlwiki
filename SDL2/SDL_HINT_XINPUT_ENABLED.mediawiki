= SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED =

A variable that lets you disable the detection and use of Xinput gamepad devices

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED "SDL_XINPUT_ENABLED"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

The variable can be set to the following values: "0" - Disable XInput
detection (only uses direct input) "1" - Enable XInput detection (the
default)

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED, "0");
//...
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Default ==

By default Xinput gamepad devices are detected.
