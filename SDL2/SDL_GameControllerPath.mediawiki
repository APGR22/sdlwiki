= SDL_GameControllerPath =

Get the implementation-dependent path for an opened game controller.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
const char* SDL_GameControllerPath(SDL_GameController *gamecontroller);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''gamecontroller'''
|a game controller identifier previously returned by [[SDL_GameControllerOpen]]()
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the implementation dependent path for the game controller, or NULL
if there is no path or the identifier passed is invalid.

== Remarks ==

This is the same path as returned by [[SDL_GameControllerNameForIndex]](),
but it takes a controller identifier instead of the (unstable) device
index.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.24.0.
