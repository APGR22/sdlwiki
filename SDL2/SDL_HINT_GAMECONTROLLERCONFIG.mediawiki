= SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG =

A variable that lets you manually hint extra gamecontroller db entries.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG "SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

The variable should be newline delimited rows of gamecontroller config
data, see [[SDL_gamecontroller]].h

This hint must be set before calling
[[SDL_Init]]([[SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER]]) You can update mappings after the
system is initialized with [[SDL_GameControllerMappingForGUID]]() and
[[SDL_GameControllerAddMapping]]()

== Default ==

By default no extra gamecontroller db entries are specified.
