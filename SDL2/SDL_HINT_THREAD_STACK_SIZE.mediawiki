= SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE =

A string specifying SDL's threads stack size in bytes or "0" for the backend's default size

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE              "SDL_THREAD_STACK_SIZE"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

Use this hint in case you need to set SDL's threads stack size to other
than the default. This is specially useful if you build SDL against a non
glibc libc library (such as musl) which provides a relatively small default
thread stack size (a few kilobytes versus the default 8MB glibc uses).
Support for this hint is currently available only in the pthread, Windows,
and PSP backend.

Instead of this hint, in 2.0.9 and later, you can use
[[SDL_CreateThreadWithStackSize]](). This hint only works with the classic
[[SDL_CreateThread]]().

== Default ==

By default the backend's default threads stack size is used.
