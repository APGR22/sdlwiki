= SDL_assert_release =
Use this function to create an assertion for release builds.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_assert_release(condition)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''condition'''
|the expression to check
|}

== Remarks ==
This function is enabled by default.  It can be disabled by setting the SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL to 0.  See the [[CategoryAssert|Assertions Category page]] for details.

One can set the environment variable "SDL_ASSERT" to one of several strings ("abort", "break", "retry", "ignore", "always_ignore") to force a default behavior, which may be desirable for automation purposes. If your platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but you're debugging an assertion in a background thread, it might be desirable to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes control as soon as assert is triggered, instead of risking a bad UI interaction (deadlock, etc) in the application.

Note that the SDL_ASSERT environment variable is an ''environment variable'' and not an SDL hint! Please refer to your platform's documentation for how to set it!
