= SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION =

Android APK expansion main file version.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION "SDL_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

Should be a string number like "1", "2" etc.

Must be set together with
[[SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_PATCH_FILE_VERSION]].

If both hints were set then [[SDL_RWFromFile]]() will look into expansion
files after a given relative path was not found in the internal storage and
assets.

By default this hint is not set and the APK expansion files are not
searched.

== Default ==

By default this hint is not set.
