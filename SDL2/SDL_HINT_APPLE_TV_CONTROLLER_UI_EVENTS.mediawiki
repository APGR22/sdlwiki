= SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_CONTROLLER_UI_EVENTS =

A variable controlling whether controllers used with the Apple TV generate UI events.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_CONTROLLER_UI_EVENTS "SDL_APPLE_TV_CONTROLLER_UI_EVENTS"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

When UI events are generated by controller input, the app will be
backgrounded when the Apple TV remote's menu button is pressed, and when
the pause or B buttons on gamepads are pressed.

More information about properly making use of controllers for the Apple TV
can be found here:
https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/remote-and-controllers/

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - Controller input
does not generate UI events (the default). "1" - Controller input generates
UI events.

== Default ==

By default controller input does not generate UI events.
