====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_HINT_RENDER_VSYNC =

A variable controlling whether updates to the SDL screen surface should be synchronized with the vertical refresh, to avoid tearing.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_RENDER_VSYNC               "SDL_RENDER_VSYNC"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - Disable vsync "1" -
Enable vsync

By default SDL does not sync screen surface updates with vertical refresh.

== Default ==

By default SDL uses the SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC flag passed into [[SDL_CreateRenderer]]().
