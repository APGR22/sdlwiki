====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_COMPILEDVERSION =

This is the version number macro for the current SDL version.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_version.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_version.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_COMPILEDVERSION \
    SDL_VERSIONNUM(SDL_MAJOR_VERSION, SDL_MINOR_VERSION, SDL_PATCHLEVEL)</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

In versions higher than 2.9.0, the minor version overflows into the
thousands digit: for example, 2.23.0 is encoded as 4300. This macro will
not be available in SDL 3.x.

Deprecated, use [[SDL_VERSION_ATLEAST]] or [[SDL_VERSION]] instead.
