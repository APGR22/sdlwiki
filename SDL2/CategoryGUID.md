# CategoryGUID

A GUID is a 128-bit value that represents something that is uniquely
identifiable by this value: because of the massive numeric space
this many bits provide, they are intended to be "globally unique."

SDL mostly uses these for identifying input devices reliably, but 
there's no reason they can't be used for any number of other things.
