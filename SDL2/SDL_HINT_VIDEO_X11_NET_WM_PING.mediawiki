= SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_PING =
A hint that specifies whether the X11 _NET_WM_PING protocol should be supported.




== Values ==
{|
|0
|disable _NET_WM_PING
|-
|1
|enable _NET_WM_PING
|}


== Default ==
By default SDL will use _NET_WM_PING, but for applications that know they will not always be able to respond to ping requests in a timely manner they can turn it off to avoid the window manager thinking the app is hung.



== Remarks ==
The hint is checked in [[SDL_CreateWindow]]().


== Version ==
This hint is available since SDL 2.0.4.
