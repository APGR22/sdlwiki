= SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_PING =

A variable controlling whether the X11 _NET_WM_PING protocol should be supported.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_PING      "SDL_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_PING"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - Disable
_NET_WM_PING "1" - Enable _NET_WM_PING

By default SDL will use _NET_WM_PING, but for applications that know they
will not always be able to respond to ping requests in a timely manner they
can turn it off to avoid the window manager thinking the app is hung. The
hint is checked in CreateWindow.

== Default ==

By default SDL will use _NET_WM_PING, but for applications that know they will not always be able to respond to ping requests in a timely manner they can turn it off to avoid the window manager thinking the app is hung.
