Joystick button event structure (event.jbutton.*)

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
typedef struct SDL_JoyButtonEvent
{
    Uint32 type;        /**< ::SDL_JOYBUTTONDOWN or ::SDL_JOYBUTTONUP */
    Uint32 timestamp;   /**< In milliseconds, populated using SDL_GetTicks() */
    SDL_JoystickID which; /**< The joystick instance id */
    Uint8 button;       /**< The joystick button index */
    Uint8 state;        /**< ::SDL_PRESSED or ::SDL_RELEASED */
    Uint8 padding1;
    Uint8 padding2;
} SDL_JoyButtonEvent;</syntaxhighlight>
