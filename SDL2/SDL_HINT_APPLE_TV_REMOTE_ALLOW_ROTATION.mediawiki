= SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION =

A variable controlling whether the Apple TV remote's joystick axes will automatically match the rotation of the remote.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION "SDL_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - Remote orientation
does not affect joystick axes (the default). "1" - Joystick axes are based
on the orientation of the remote.

== Default ==

By default remote orientation does not affect joystick axes.
