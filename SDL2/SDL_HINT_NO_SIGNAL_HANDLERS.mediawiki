= SDL_HINT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS =

Tell SDL not to catch the SIGINT or SIGTERM signals.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS   "SDL_NO_SIGNAL_HANDLERS"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This hint only applies to Unix-like platforms, and should set before any
calls to [[SDL_Init]]()

The variable can be set to the following values: "0" - SDL will install a
SIGINT and SIGTERM handler, and when it catches a signal, convert it into
an [[SDL_QUIT]] event. "1" - SDL will not install a signal handler at all.

== Default ==

By default install a SIGINT and SIGTERM handler, and when it catches a signal, convert it into an SDL_QUIT event.
