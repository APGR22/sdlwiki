= SDL_GameControllerAxis =

The list of axes available from a controller

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_gamecontroller.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_gamecontroller.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
typedef enum SDL_GameControllerAxis
{
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_INVALID = -1,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_LEFTX,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_LEFTY,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_RIGHTX,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_RIGHTY,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_TRIGGERLEFT,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_TRIGGERRIGHT,
    SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_MAX
} SDL_GameControllerAxis;</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

Thumbstick axis values range from [[SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MIN]] to
[[SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX]], and are centered within ~8000 of zero, though
advanced UI will allow users to set or autodetect the dead zone, which
varies between controllers.

Trigger axis values range from 0 (released) to [[SDL_JOYSTICK_AXIS_MAX]]
(fully pressed) when reported by [[SDL_GameControllerGetAxis]](). Note that
this is not the same range that will be reported by the lower-level
[[SDL_GetJoystickAxis]]().
