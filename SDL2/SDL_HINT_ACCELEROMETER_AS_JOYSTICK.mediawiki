====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK =

A variable controlling whether the Android / iOS built-in accelerometer should be listed as a joystick device.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK "SDL_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This variable can be set to the following values: "0" - The accelerometer
is not listed as a joystick "1" - The accelerometer is available as a 3
axis joystick (the default).

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
#include "SDL.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // This disables the use of gyroscopes as axis device
    SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK, "0");
}

</syntaxhighlight>

== Default ==

By default SDL will list real joysticks along with the accelerometer as if it were a 3 axis joystick.
