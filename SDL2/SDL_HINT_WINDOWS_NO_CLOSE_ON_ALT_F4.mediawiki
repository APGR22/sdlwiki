= SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_NO_CLOSE_ON_ALT_F4 =

Tell SDL not to generate window-close events for Alt+F4 on Windows.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
#define SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_NO_CLOSE_ON_ALT_F4 "SDL_WINDOWS_NO_CLOSE_ON_ALT_F4"</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

The variable can be set to the following values: "0" - SDL will generate a
window-close event when it sees Alt+F4. "1" - SDL will only do normal key
handling for Alt+F4.

== Default ==

By default SDL will generate an [[SDL_WindowEvent|SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE]] event for Alt+F4.
