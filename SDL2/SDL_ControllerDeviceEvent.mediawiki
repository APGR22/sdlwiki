= SDL_ControllerDeviceEvent =

Controller device event structure (event.cdevice.*)

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_events.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_events.h), but apps should _only_ `#include "SDL.h"`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
typedef struct SDL_ControllerDeviceEvent
{
    Uint32 type;        /**< ::SDL_CONTROLLERDEVICEADDED, ::SDL_CONTROLLERDEVICEREMOVED, ::SDL_CONTROLLERDEVICEREMAPPED, or ::SDL_CONTROLLERSTEAMHANDLEUPDATED */
    Uint32 timestamp;   /**< In milliseconds, populated using SDL_GetTicks() */
    Sint32 which;       /**< The joystick device index for the ADDED event, instance id for the REMOVED or REMAPPED event */
} SDL_ControllerDeviceEvent;</syntaxhighlight>

== Data Fields ==
