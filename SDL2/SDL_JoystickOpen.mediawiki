= SDL_JoystickOpen =

Open a joystick for use.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Joystick* SDL_JoystickOpen(int device_index);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''device_index'''
|the index of the joystick to query
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a joystick identifier or NULL if an error occurred; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

The <code>device_index</code> argument refers to the N'th joystick
presently recognized by SDL on the system. It is '''NOT''' the same as the
instance ID used to identify the joystick in future events. See
[[SDL_JoystickInstanceID]]() for more details about instance IDs.

The joystick subsystem must be initialized before a joystick can be opened
for use.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
