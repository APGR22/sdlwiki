= SDL_GetWindowSize =

Get the size of a window's client area.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_GetWindowSize(SDL_Window * window, int *w,
                       int *h);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window to query the width and height from
|-
|'''w'''
|a pointer filled in with the width of the window, in screen coordinates, may be NULL
|-
|'''h'''
|a pointer filled in with the height of the window, in screen coordinates, may be NULL
|}

== Remarks ==

NULL can safely be passed as the <code>w</code> or <code>h</code> parameter
if the width or height value is not desired.

The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels,
if the window was created with <code>[[SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI]]</code> on
a platform with high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or macOS). Use
[[SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize]](), [[SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize]](), or
[[SDL_GetRendererOutputSize]]() to get the real client area size in pixels.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
