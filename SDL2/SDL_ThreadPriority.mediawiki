====== (This is the legacy documentation for stable SDL2, the current stable version; [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/ SDL3] is the current development version.) ======
= SDL_ThreadPriority =

The SDL thread priority.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_thread.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/include/SDL_thread.h)

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
typedef enum SDL_ThreadPriority {
    SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_LOW,
    SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL,
    SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGH,
    SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL
} SDL_ThreadPriority;</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

SDL will make system changes as necessary in order to apply the thread
priority. Code which attempts to control thread state related to priority
should be aware that calling [[SDL_SetThreadPriority]] may alter such
state. [[SDL_HINT_THREAD_PRIORITY_POLICY]] can be used to control aspects
of this behavior.
