= SDL_SetColorKey =
Use this function to set the color key (transparent pixel) in a surface.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetColorKey(SDL_Surface* surface,
                    int          flag,
                    Uint32       key)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to update
|-
|'''flag'''
|SDL_TRUE to enable color key, SDL_FALSE to disable color key
|-
|'''key'''
|the transparent pixel
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The color key defines a pixel value that will be treated as transparent in a blit.  It is a pixel of the format used by the surface, as generated by [[SDL_MapRGB]]().


RLE acceleration can substantially speed up blitting of images with large horizontal runs of transparent pixels.  See [[SDL_SetSurfaceRLE]]() for details.
