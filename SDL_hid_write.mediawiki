= SDL_hid_write =

Write an Output report to a HID device.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_hid_write(SDL_hid_device *dev, const unsigned char *data, size_t length);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''dev'''
|A device handle returned from [[SDL_hid_open]]().
|-
|'''data'''
|The data to send, including the report number as the first byte.
|-
|'''length'''
|The length in bytes of the data to send.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the actual number of bytes written and -1 on error.

== Remarks ==

The first byte of <code>data</code> must contain the Report ID. For devices
which only support a single report, this must be set to 0x0. The remaining
bytes contain the report data. Since the Report ID is mandatory, calls to
[[SDL_hid_write]]() will always contain one more byte than the report
contains. For example, if a hid report is 16 bytes long, 17 bytes must be
passed to [[SDL_hid_write]](), the Report ID (or 0x0, for devices with a
single report), followed by the report data (16 bytes). In this example,
the length passed in would be 17.

[[SDL_hid_write]]() will send the data on the first OUT endpoint, if one
exists. If it does not, it will send the data through the Control Endpoint
(Endpoint 0).

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.18.
