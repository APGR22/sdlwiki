= SDL_RWtell =
Use this function to determine the current read/write offset in an SDL_RWops data stream.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Sint64 SDL_RWtell(struct SDL_RWops* context)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''context''' 
|a SDL_RWops data stream object from which to get the current offset
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns the current offset in the stream, or -1 if the information can not be determined.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
extern SDL_RWops *rw;
printf("Current position in stream: %lld\n", (long long) SDL_RWtell(rw));
if (SDL_RWseek(rw, 0, RW_SEEK_END) != -1) {
    printf("Final position in stream: %lld\n", (long long) SDL_RWtell(rw));
}
```

== Remarks ==
SDL_RWtell is actually a macro that calls the SDL_RWops's '''seek''' method, with an offset of 0 bytes from RW_SEEK_CUR, to simplify application development.
