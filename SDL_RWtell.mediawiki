= SDL_RWtell =
Use this function ^(macro)^ to *perform a do-nothing seek to get the current offset in an SDL_RWops stream*.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_RWtell(ctx)
```

<<Color2(green,Should there be anything to indicate a RV at the beginning of the syntax? Should the following be included in the syntax section?)>>

```(ctx)->seek(ctx, 0, RW_SEEK_CUR)```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''ctx'''
|*a pointer to an SDL_RWops structure*
|}

== Return Value ==
*Returns the ^current^ offset in the stream.*

== Code Examples ==
*
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "SDL_rwops.h"

int main()
{
  SDL_RWops *rw=SDL_RWFromFile("test.bin","r");
  if(rw==NULL)
  {
    fprintf(stderr,"Couldn't open test.bin\n");
    return(1);
  }

  SDL_RWseek(rw,0,RW_SEEK_END);
  fprintf(stderr,"Final position in test.bin: %d\n",SDL_RWtell(rw));
  SDL_RWclose(rw);
  return(0);
}
```
*

== Remarks ==
,,Note: ,,This is not a built-in function. This is a macro that calls whatever seek function that happens to be pointed to in an SDL_RWops structure.
