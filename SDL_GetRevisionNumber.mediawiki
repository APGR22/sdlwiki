= SDL_GetRevisionNumber =
'''DEPRECATED'''
Use this function to get the revision number of SDL that is linked against your program.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int SDL_GetRevisionNumber(void)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==
Returns a number uniquely identifying the exact revision of the SDL library in use. 

== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
You can add your code example here
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
After SDL's migration to GitHub (before the 2.0.16 release), this function is marked deprecated and hardcoded to return zero. Don't call this anymore. [[SDL_GetRevision]] still works, and if SDL was carefully built, will return a git hash.
