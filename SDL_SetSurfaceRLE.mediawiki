Use this function to set the RLE acceleration hint for a surface.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetSurfaceRLE(SDL_Surface* surface,
                      int          flag)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to ,,set,, ^optimize???^
|-
|'''flag'''
|0 to ^disable?^, non-zero to ^enable?^ RLE acceleration
|}

```

== Remarks ==
If RLE is enabled, colorkey and alpha blending blits are much faster, but the surface must be locked before directly accessing the pixels.
