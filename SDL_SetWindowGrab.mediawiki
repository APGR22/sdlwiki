= SDL_SetWindowGrab =

Set a window's input grab mode.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SetWindowGrab(SDL_Window * window,
                       SDL_bool grabbed);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window for which the input grab mode should be set
|-
|'''grabbed'''
|[[SDL_TRUE]] to grab input or [[SDL_FALSE]] to release input
|}

When input is grabbed the mouse is confined to the window.

If the caller enables a grab while another window is currently grabbed, the
other window loses its grab in favor of the caller's window.
