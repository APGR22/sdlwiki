= SDL_SetWindowSize =
Use this function to set the size of a window's client area.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_SetWindowSize(SDL_Window* window,
                       int         w,
                       int         h)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window to change
|-
|'''w'''
|the width of the window in pixels, in screen coordinates, must be > 0
|-
|'''h'''
|the height of the window in pixels, in screen coordinates, must be > 0
|}

== Remarks ==
The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if the window was created with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI on a platform with high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or OS X). Use [[SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize]]() or [[SDL_GetRendererOutputSize]]() to get the real client area size in pixels.

Fullscreen windows automatically match the size of the display mode, and you should use [[SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode]]() to change their size.
