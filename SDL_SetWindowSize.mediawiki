====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SetWindowSize =

Set the size of a window's client area.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SetWindowSize(SDL_Window * window, int w,
                       int h);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window to change
|-
|'''w'''
|the width of the window in pixels, in screen coordinates, must be > 0
|-
|'''h'''
|the height of the window in pixels, in screen coordinates, must be > 0
|}

== Remarks ==

The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels,
if the window was created with <code>[[SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI]]</code> on
a platform with high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or macOS). Use
[[SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize]]() or [[SDL_GetRendererOutputSize]]() to get the
real client area size in pixels.

Fullscreen windows automatically match the size of the display mode, and
you should use [[SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode]]() to change their size.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
