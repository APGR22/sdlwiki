Get the size of a window's borders (decorations) around the client area.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetWindowBordersSize(SDL_Window * window,
                             int *top, int *left,
                             int *bottom, int *right);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window to query the size values of the border (decorations) from
|-
|'''top'''
|pointer to variable for storing the size of the top border; NULL is permitted
|-
|'''left'''
|pointer to variable for storing the size of the left border; NULL is permitted
|-
|'''bottom'''
|pointer to variable for storing the size of the bottom border; NULL is permitted
|-

|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.



== Remarks ==

Note: If this function fails (returns -1), the size values will be
initialized to 0, 0, 0, 0 (if a non-NULL pointer is provided), as if the
window in question was borderless.

This function also returns -1 if getting the information is not supported.
