<!-- #Leave this section as-is unless you have a code example to put in.  In that case, replace You can add your code example here with your code example following the Style Guide instructions.  Leave the rest of the markup alone and delete this comment. -->


== Remarks ==
The higher resolution the timer, the more frequently the CPU services timer interrupts, and the more precise delays are, but this takes up power and CPU time. This hint is only used on Windows 7 and earlier.

See this blog post for more information:

If this variable is set to "0", the system timer resolution is not set.

This hint may be set at any time.
