= SDL_Metal_CreateView =

Create a CAMetalLayer-backed NSView/UIView and attach it to the specified window.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_MetalView SDL_Metal_CreateView(SDL_Window * window);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

On macOS, this does ''not'' associate a MTLDevice with the CAMetalLayer on
its own. It is up to user code to do that.

The returned handle can be casted directly to a NSView or UIView. To access
the backing CAMetalLayer, call [[SDL_Metal_GetLayer]]().
