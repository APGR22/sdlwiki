= SDL_GetKeyboardState =
Use this function to get a snapshot of the current state of the keyboard.


== Syntax ==
```c++
Uint8* SDL_GetKeyboardState(int* numkeys)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''numkeys'''
|if non-NULL, receives the length of the returned array
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns ^a pointer to^ an array of key states. *A value of 1 means that the key is pressed and a value of 0 means that it is not.*  Indexes into this array are obtained by using [[SDL_scancode]] values.  *The pointer returned is a pointer to an internal SDL array. It will be valid for the whole lifetime of the application and should not be freed by the caller.*

== Code Examples ==
<<Color2(green,Is this entered correctly? Does the \code and \endcode go in or is that doxygen markup in the header?  There is a different example in the old wiki.)>>
```c++
Uint8 *state = SDL_GetKeyboardState(NULL);
if ( state[SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN] ) {
    printf("<RETURN> is pressed.\n");
}
```

== Remarks ==
*<<Color2(green,From [[SDL_GetKeyState]] in old wiki.)>><br/>
Note: Use [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() to update the state array.

Note: This function gives you the current state after all events have been processed, so if a key or button has been pressed and released before you process events, then the pressed state will never show up in the <code>getstate</code> <<Color2(green,formatting here ok?)>> calls.

Note: This function doesn't take into account whether shift has been pressed or not. <br/>*
