= SDL_Metal_GetDrawableSize =

Get the size of a window's underlying drawable in pixels (for use with setting viewport, scissor & etc).

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_Metal_GetDrawableSize(SDL_Window* window, int *w,
                               int *h);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|[[SDL_Window]] from which the drawable size should be queried
|-
|'''w'''
|Pointer to variable for storing the width in pixels, may be NULL
|-
|'''h'''
|Pointer to variable for storing the height in pixels, may be NULL
 This may differ from [[SDL_GetWindowSize]]() if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with [[SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI]] on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the \c [[SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED]] hint.
