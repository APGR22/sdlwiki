= SDL_CondWait =
Use this function to wait until a condition variable is signaled.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_CondWait(SDL_cond*  cond,
                 SDL_mutex* mutex)
```
== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''cond''' 
|the condition variable to wait on
|-
|'''mutex''' 
|the mutex used to coordinate thread access
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 when it is signaled or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
<<Include(SDL_CreateCond, , , from="## Begin Condition Variable Example", to="## End Condition Variable Example")>>

== Remarks ==
This function unlocks the specified '''mutex''' and waits on another thread to call [[SDL_CondSignal]]() or [[SDL_CondBroadcast]]() on the condition variable '''cond'''.  Once the condition variable is signaled, the mutex is re-locked and the function returns.

The mutex must be locked before calling this function.

This function is the equivalent of calling [[SDL_CondWaitTimeout]]() with a time length of SDL_MUTEX_MAXWAIT.
