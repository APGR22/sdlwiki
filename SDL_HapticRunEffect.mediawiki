= SDL_HapticRunEffect =

Run the haptic effect on its associated haptic device.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_HapticRunEffect(SDL_Haptic * haptic,
                        int effect,
                        Uint32 iterations);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''haptic'''
|the [[SDL_Haptic]] device to run the effect on
|-
|'''effect'''
|the ID of the haptic effect to run
|-
|'''iterations'''
|the number of iterations to run the effect; use <code>[[SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY]]</code> to repeat forever
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

To repeat the effect over and over indefinitely, set
<code>iterations</code> to <code>[[SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY]]</code>. (Repeats
the envelope - attack and fade.) To make one instance of the effect last
indefinitely (so the effect does not fade), set the effect's
<code>length</code> in its structure/union to
<code>[[SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY]]</code> instead.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
