= SDL_HapticRunEffect =
Use this function to run the haptic effect on ''its associated'' haptic device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_HapticRunEffect(SDL_Haptic* haptic,
                        int         effect,
                        Uint32      iterations)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''haptic'''
|^a pointer to the^ haptic device to run the effect on
|-
|'''effect'''
|^ID^ ,,identifier,, of the haptic effect to run
|-
|'''iterations'''
|^the^ number of iterations to run the effect; use SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY for infinity
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If iterations are SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY, it'll run the effect over and over repeating the envelope (attack and fade) every time. If you only want the effect to last forever, set SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY in the effect's length parameter. <<Color2(green,This doesn't really make sense but I don't have enough info to suggest a fix.)>>
