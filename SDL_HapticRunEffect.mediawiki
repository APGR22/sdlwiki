'''DRAFT'''

= SDL_HapticRunEffect =
Use this function to run the haptic effect on its associated haptic device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_HapticRunEffect(SDL_Haptic* haptic,
                        int         effect,
                        Uint32      iterations)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''haptic'''
|the SDL_Haptic device to run the effect on
|-
|'''effect'''
|the <!-- ID --> identifier of the haptic effect to run
|-
|'''iterations'''
|the number of iterations to run the effect; use SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY for infinity <!-- ''-or-'' the number of times to repeat the effect; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details --> 
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If '''iterations''' are SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY, it'll run the effect over and over repeating the envelope (attack and fade) every time. If you only want the effect to last forever, set SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY in the effect's <code>length</code> parameter.

<!-- ''-or-'' -->

<!-- To repeat the effect over and over indefinitely, set '''iterations''' to SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY.  (Repeats the envelope - attack and fade.)  To make one instance of the effect last indefinitely (so the effect does not fade), set the effect's <code>length</code> in its structure/union to SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY instead. -->

<!-- <span style="color: green;">Is it important to say how to end an effect that has an SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY setting or is it enough to list the destroy function below?</span> -->

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
