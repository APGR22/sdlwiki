= FAQ: Licensing =


== What license does SDL use? ==
SDL is freely available under the GNU LGPL license, and may be used in both free and commercial applications.

== Can I use SDL in a commercial application? ==
Yes!
If you link dynamically (via .dll's, .so's or using other dynamic linking devices) then you do not need to do anything.
If you link statically (include the SDL source inside your project when you compile) you have to provide some way for your customer to relink your application with a custom version of SDL.
The details are available at: http://www.libsdl.org/license.php

== Can I use SDL in an embedded application? ==
Yes!
The details are available at: http://www.libsdl.org/license.php

== If I use SDL, do I owe any licensing fees or royalties? ==
No!
You may use SDL completely free of charge. If you would like to donate, you may do so via PayPal to slouken@libsdl.org

== Can I use code from the test directory? From the examples? ==
Yes, code from the test directory and from the examples in the documentation is placed in the public domain. Anyone can use it for any purpose.

== Can I use code from the demos in my applications? ==
Each of the demos has it's own licensing restrictions. See the "COPYING" file in each demo's source directory for more information on a particular demo.
