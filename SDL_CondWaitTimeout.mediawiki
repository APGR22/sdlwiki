```c++
int SDL_CondWaitTimeout(SDL_cond*  cond,
                        SDL_mutex* mutex,
                        Uint32     ms)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''cond'''
|^a pointer to the SDL_cond structure that is being applied^ ???
|-
|'''mutex'''
|^a pointer to the SDL_mutex structure to be timed out^ ???
|-
|'''ms'''
|^the maximum number of milliseconds to wait^
|}

== Return Value ==

== Remarks ==
/!\ {i} On some platforms this function is implemented by looping with a delay of 1 ms, and so should be avoided if possible.
