= SDL_CondWaitTimeout =
Use this function to ^wait on a condition variable for a fixed delay^ ''-or-'' *with timeout*.

<<Color2(green,The description in the header is too long and too detailed.  Tried to write a simple summary.  Should it be the longer description here instead?<br/>Waits for at most '''ms''' milliseconds and returns 0 if the condition variable is signaled SDL_MUTEX_TIMEDOUT if the condition is not signaled in the allotted time and -1 on error. (with appropriate commas that don't work in green))>>


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_CondWaitTimeout(SDL_cond*  cond,
                        SDL_mutex* mutex,
                        Uint32     ms)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''cond'''
|^a pointer to the condition variable that is being applied^ ???
|-
|'''mutex'''
|^a pointer to the mutex to be timed out^ ???
|-
|'''ms'''
|^the maximum number of milliseconds to wait^
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 if the condition variable is signaled, SDL_MUTEX_TIMEDOUT if the condition is not signaled in the allotted time, or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
*<br/>'''mutex''' is unlocked so it must be locked when the function is called and it will ,,re-,, ^un^lock afterward.

<<Color2(green,Is this a typo in the old wiki - ''re'' vs ''un''lock?  Does the function handle the locking/unlocking or does the programmer need to do that?)>><br/>*

On some platforms this function is implemented by looping with a delay of 1 ms, and so should be avoided if possible.
