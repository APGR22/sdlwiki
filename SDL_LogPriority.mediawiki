```

== Remarks ==
By default logs are quiet, but if you're debugging SDL you might want:
 ```SDL_LogSetAllPriority(SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_WARN);```

By default the SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION category is enabled at the INFO level and all other [[SDL_LOG_CATEGORY]] categories are enabled at the CRITICAL level.
