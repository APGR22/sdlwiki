= SDL_PauseAudio =
This function is a legacy means of pausing the audio device. New programs might want to use [[SDL_PauseAudioDevice]]() instead.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_PauseAudio(int pause_on)
```

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''pause_on'''
|non-zero to pause, 0 to unpause
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_PauseAudio(1);  // audio callback is stopped when this returns.
SDL_Delay(5000);  // audio device plays silence for 5 seconds
SDL_PauseAudio(0);  // audio callback starts running again.
```

== Remarks ==
This function is equivalent to calling

```c++
SDL_PauseAudioDevice(1, pause_on);
```

and is only useful if you used the legacy [[SDL_OpenAudio]]() function.
