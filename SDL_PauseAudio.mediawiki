====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_PauseAudio =

This function is a legacy means of pausing the audio device.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_PauseAudio(int pause_on);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''pause_on'''
|non-zero to pause, 0 to unpause
|}

== Remarks ==

New programs might want to use [[SDL_PauseAudioDevice]]() instead. This
function is equivalent to calling...

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_PauseAudioDevice(1, pause_on);
</syntaxhighlight>

...and is only useful if you used the legacy [[SDL_OpenAudio]]() function.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_PauseAudio(1);  // audio callback is stopped when this returns.
SDL_Delay(5000);  // audio device plays silence for 5 seconds
SDL_PauseAudio(0);  // audio callback starts running again.
</syntaxhighlight>
