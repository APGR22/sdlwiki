= SDL_UnlockAudio =
Use this function to unlock the callback function.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_UnlockAudio(void)
```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
Unlocks a previous [[SDL_LockAudio]]() call. 

The lock manipulated by these functions protects the callback function.  During a [[SDL_LockAudio]]()/SDL_UnlockAudio() pair, you can be guaranteed that the callback function is not running.  

Do not call these from the callback function or you will cause deadlock.
