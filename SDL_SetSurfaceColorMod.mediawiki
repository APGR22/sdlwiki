= SDL_SetSurfaceColorMod =
Use this function to set an additional color value multiplied into blit operations.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_SetSurfaceColorMod(SDL_Surface* surface,
                           Uint8        r,
                           Uint8        g,
                           Uint8        b)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to update
|-
|'''r'''
|the red color value multiplied into blit operations
|-
|'''g'''
|the green color value multiplied into blit operations
|-
|'''b'''
|the blue color value multiplied into blit operations
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
When this surface is blitted, during the blit operation each source color channel is modulated by the appropriate color value according to the following formula:
 <code>srcC = srcC * (color / 255)</code>
