Set an additional color value multiplied into blit operations.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetSurfaceColorMod(SDL_Surface * surface,

</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to update
|-
|'''r'''
|the red color value multiplied into blit operations
|-
|'''g'''
|the green color value multiplied into blit operations
|-
|'''b'''
|the blue color value multiplied into blit operations
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

When this surface is blitted, during the blit operation each source color

<code>srcC = srcC * (color / 255)</code>
