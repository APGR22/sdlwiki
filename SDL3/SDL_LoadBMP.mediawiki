====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_LoadBMP =

Load a BMP image from a file.

== Header File ==

Defined in [SDL_surface.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_surface.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface* SDL_LoadBMP(const char *file);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''file'''
|the BMP file to load
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to a new [[SDL_Surface]] structure or NULL if there was
an error; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

The new surface should be freed with [[SDL_DestroySurface]](). Not doing so
will result in a memory leak.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
const char *image_path = "myimage.bmp";
SDL_Surface *image = SDL_LoadBMP(image_path);

/* Let the user know if the file failed to load */
if (!image) {
    printf("Failed to load image at %s: %s\n", image_path, SDL_GetError());
    return;
}

/* Do something with image here. */

/* Make sure to eventually release the surface resource */
SDL_DestroySurface(image);
</syntaxhighlight>
