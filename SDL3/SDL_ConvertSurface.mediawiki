====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_ConvertSurface =

Copy an existing surface to a new surface of the specified format.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_Surface* SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface *surface,
                                const SDL_PixelFormat *format);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''surface'''
|the existing [[SDL_Surface]] structure to convert
|-
|'''format'''
|the [[SDL_PixelFormat]] structure that the new surface is optimized for
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the new [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is created or NULL if it
fails; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

This function is used to optimize images for faster ''repeat'' blitting.
This is accomplished by converting the original and storing the result as a
new surface. The new, optimized surface can then be used as the source for
future blits, making them faster.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>

// SDL_Surface *input = ...;
SDL_PixelFormat *format = SDL_AllocFormat(SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA32);
SDL_Surface *output = SDL_ConvertSurface(input, format, 0);
SDL_FreeFormat(format);

</syntaxhighlight>
