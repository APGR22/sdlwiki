# SDL_JoyButtonEvent

Joystick button event structure (event.jbutton.*)

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_events.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_events.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

## Syntax

```c
typedef struct SDL_JoyButtonEvent
{
    SDL_EventType type; /**< ::SDL_EVENT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_DOWN or ::SDL_EVENT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_UP */
    Uint32 reserved;
    Uint64 timestamp;   /**< In nanoseconds, populated using SDL_GetTicksNS() */
    SDL_JoystickID which; /**< The joystick instance id */
    Uint8 button;       /**< The joystick button index */
    Uint8 state;        /**< ::SDL_PRESSED or ::SDL_RELEASED */
    Uint8 padding1;
    Uint8 padding2;
} SDL_JoyButtonEvent;
```
