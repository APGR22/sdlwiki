====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SetMainReady =

Circumvent failure of [[SDL_Init]]() when not using [[SDL_main]]() as an entry point.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SetMainReady(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

This function is defined in [[SDL_main]].h, along with the preprocessor
rule to redefine main() as [[SDL_main]](). Thus to ensure that your main()
function will not be changed it is necessary to define [[SDL_MAIN_HANDLED]]
before including SDL.h.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
#define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED
#include "SDL.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    SDL_SetMainReady();
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

    ...

    SDL_Quit();

    return 0;
}
</syntaxhighlight>
