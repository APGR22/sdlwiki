====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SetRenderTarget =

Set a texture as the current rendering target.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetRenderTarget(SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_Texture *texture);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the rendering context
|-
|'''texture'''
|the targeted texture, which must be created with the <code>[[SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET]]</code> flag, or NULL to render to the window instead of a texture.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

Before using this function, you should check the
<code>[[SDL_RENDERER_TARGETTEXTURE]]</code> bit in the flags of
[[SDL_RendererInfo]] to see if render targets are supported.

The default render target is the window for which the renderer was created.
To stop rendering to a texture and render to the window again, call this
function with a NULL <code>texture</code>.

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
