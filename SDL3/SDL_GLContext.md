###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_GLContext

An opaque handle to an OpenGL context.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_video.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

## Syntax

```c
typedef void *SDL_GLContext;
```
