====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SaveBMP =

Save a surface to a file.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SaveBMP(SDL_Surface *surface, const char *file);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure containing the image to be saved
|-
|'''file'''
|a file to save to
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

Surfaces with a 24-bit, 32-bit and paletted 8-bit format get saved in the
BMP directly. Other RGB formats with 8-bit or higher get converted to a
24-bit surface or, if they have an alpha mask or a colorkey, to a 32-bit
surface before they are saved. YUV and paletted 1-bit and 4-bit formats are
not supported.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>

    ...

    SDL_Surface *sfc = ...

    ...
  
    if(SDL_SaveBMP(sfc, "somefile.bmp") != 0)
    {
        // Error saving bitmap
        printf("SDL_SaveBMP failed: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
    }
</syntaxhighlight>
