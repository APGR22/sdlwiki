====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_SetRenderIntegerScale =

Set whether to force integer scales for resolution-independent rendering.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetRenderIntegerScale(SDL_Renderer *renderer, SDL_bool enable);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the renderer for which integer scaling should be set
|-
|'''enable'''
|enable or disable the integer scaling for rendering
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

This function restricts the logical viewport to integer values - that is,
when a resolution is between two multiples of a logical size, the viewport
size is rounded down to the lower multiple.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
