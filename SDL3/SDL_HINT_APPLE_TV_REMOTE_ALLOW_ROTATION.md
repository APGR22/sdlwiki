###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION

A variable controlling whether the Apple TV remote's joystick axes will automatically match the rotation of the remote.

## Header File

Defined in [SDL_hints.h](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h), but apps should _only_ `#include <SDL3/SDL.h>`!

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION "SDL_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION"
```

## Remarks

The variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": Remote orientation does not affect joystick axes. (default)
- "1": Joystick axes are based on the orientation of the remote.

This hint can be set anytime.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
