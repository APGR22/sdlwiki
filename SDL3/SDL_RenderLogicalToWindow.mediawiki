====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_RenderLogicalToWindow =

Get real coordinates of point in window when given logical coordinates of point in renderer.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_RenderLogicalToWindow(SDL_Renderer *renderer,
                               float logicalX, float logicalY,
                               float *windowX, float *windowY);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the renderer from which the window coordinates should be calculated
|-
|'''logicalX'''
|the logical x coordinate
|-
|'''logicalY'''
|the logical y coordinate
|-
|'''windowX'''
|the pointer filled with the real X coordinate in the window
|-
|'''windowY'''
|the pointer filled with the real Y coordinate in the window
|}

== Remarks ==

Logical coordinates will differ from real coordinates when render is scaled
and logical renderer size set

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
