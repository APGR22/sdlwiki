====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetRevisionNumber =

Obsolete function, do not use.

== Deprecated ==

Use [[SDL_GetRevision]]() instead; if SDL was carefully built, it will
return a git hash.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetRevisionNumber(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns zero, always, in modern SDL releases.

== Remarks ==

When SDL was hosted in a Mercurial repository, and was built carefully,
this would return the revision number that the build was created from. This
number was not reliable for several reasons, but more importantly, SDL is
now hosted in a git repository, which does not offer numbers at all, only
hashes. This function only ever returns zero now. Don't use it.

Before SDL 2.0.16, this might have returned an unreliable, but non-zero
number.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
