====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_RWtell =

Determine the current read/write offset in an [[SDL_RWops]] data stream.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
Sint64 SDL_RWtell(SDL_RWops *context);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''context'''
|a [[SDL_RWops]] data stream object from which to get the current offset
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the current offset in the stream, or -1 if the information can not
be determined.

== Remarks ==

[[SDL_RWtell]] is actually a wrapper function that calls the
[[SDL_RWops]]'s <code>seek</code> method, with an offset of 0 bytes from
<code>[[SDL_RW_SEEK_CUR]]</code>, to simplify application development.

Prior to SDL 2.0.10, this function was a macro.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
extern SDL_RWops *rw;
printf("Current position in stream: %lld\n", (long long) SDL_RWtell(rw));
if (SDL_RWseek(rw, 0, RW_SEEK_END) != -1) {
    printf("Final position in stream: %lld\n", (long long) SDL_RWtell(rw));
}
</syntaxhighlight>
