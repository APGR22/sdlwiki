====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_RenderWindowToLogical =

Get logical coordinates of point in renderer when given real coordinates of point in window.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_RenderWindowToLogical(SDL_Renderer *renderer,
                               float windowX, float windowY,
                               float *logicalX, float *logicalY);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the renderer from which the logical coordinates should be calculated
|-
|'''windowX'''
|the real X coordinate in the window
|-
|'''windowY'''
|the real Y coordinate in the window
|-
|'''logicalX'''
|the pointer filled with the logical x coordinate
|-
|'''logicalY'''
|the pointer filled with the logical y coordinate
|}

== Remarks ==

Logical coordinates will differ from real coordinates when render is scaled
and logical renderer size set

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
