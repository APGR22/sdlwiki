====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetTicks =

Get the number of milliseconds since SDL library initialization.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
Uint32 SDL_GetTicks(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns an unsigned 32-bit value representing the number of milliseconds
since the SDL library initialized.

== Remarks ==

This value wraps if the program runs for more than ~49 days.

This function is not recommended as of SDL 2.0.18; use [[SDL_GetTicks64]]()
instead, where the value doesn't wrap every ~49 days. There are places in
SDL where we provide a 32-bit timestamp that can not change without
breaking binary compatibility, though, so this function isn't officially
deprecated.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
unsigned int lastTime = 0, currentTime;
while (!quit) {
  // do stuff
  // ...

  // Print a report once per second
  currentTime = SDL_GetTicks();
  if (currentTime > lastTime + 1000) {
    printf("Report: %d\n", variable);
    lastTime = currentTime;
  }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
