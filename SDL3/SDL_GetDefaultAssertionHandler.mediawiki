====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [https://wiki.libsdl.org/ SDL2] is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetDefaultAssertionHandler =

Get the default assertion handler.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_AssertionHandler SDL_GetDefaultAssertionHandler(void);

== Return Value ==

triggers.

== Remarks ==

This returns the function pointer that is called by default when an
assertion is triggered. This is an internal function provided by SDL, that
is used for assertions when [[SDL_SetAssertionHandler]]() hasn't been used
to provide a different function.

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
