= SDL_QuitRequested =
Use this function to see whether an SDL_EVENT_QUIT event is queued.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_bool SDL_QuitRequested(void)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_TRUE if SDL_EVENT_QUIT is queued or SDL_FALSE otherwise.

== Remarks ==
This is actually a macro that calls [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() followed by [[SDL_PeepEvents]](). Since it pumps the event queue, it can only be used in the main thread.

It's perfectly normal for applications to just look for SDL_EVENT_QUIT in their event loop, too, without using this macro.
