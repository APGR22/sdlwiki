====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_LockJoysticks =

Locking for multi-threaded access to the joystick API 

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_LockJoysticks(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

If you are using the joystick API or handling events from multiple threads
you should use these locking functions to protect access to the joysticks.

In particular, you are guaranteed that the joystick list won't change, so
the API functions that take a joystick index will be valid, and joystick
and game controller events will not be delivered.

As of SDL 2.26.0, you can take the joystick lock around reinitializing the
joystick subsystem, to prevent other threads from seeing joysticks in an
uninitialized state. However, all open joysticks will be closed and SDL
functions called with them will fail.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
