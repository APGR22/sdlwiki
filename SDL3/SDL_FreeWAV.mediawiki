= SDL_FreeWAV =

Free data previously allocated with [[SDL_LoadWAV]]() or [[SDL_LoadWAV_RW]]().

</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''audio_buf'''
|a pointer to the buffer created by [[SDL_LoadWAV]]() or [[SDL_LoadWAV_RW]]()
|}

[[SDL_FreeWAV]](). It is safe to call this function with a NULL pointer.
