= SDL_GetGamepadButtonFromString =

Convert a string into an [[SDL_GamepadButton]] enum.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_GamepadButton SDL_GetGamepadButtonFromString(const char *str);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''str'''
|string representing a [[SDL_Gamepad]] axis
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the [[SDL_GamepadButton]] enum corresponding to the input string,
or <code>[[SDL_GAMEPAD_AXIS_INVALID]]</code> if no match was found.

== Remarks ==

This function is called internally to translate [[SDL_Gamepad]] mapping
strings for the underlying joystick device into the consistent
[[SDL_Gamepad]] mapping. You do not normally need to call this function
unless you are parsing [[SDL_Gamepad]] mappings in your own code.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
