= SDL_SetSurfaceAlphaMod =

Set an additional alpha value used in blit operations.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_SetSurfaceAlphaMod(SDL_Surface *surface,
                           Uint8 alpha);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''surface'''
|the [[SDL_Surface]] structure to update
|-

|the alpha value multiplied into blit operations
|}

== Return Value ==

[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

When this surface is blitted, during the blit operation the source alpha
value is modulated by this alpha value according to the following formula:

<code>srcA = srcA * (alpha / 255)</code>
