= SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_PATCH_FILE_VERSION =
A hint that specifies the Android APK expansion patch file version.




== Values ==
{|
|X
|the Android APK expansion patch file version (should be a string number like "1", "2" etc.)
|}


== Default ==
By default this hint is not set.



== Remarks ==
This hint must be set together with the hint [[SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION]].

If both hints were set then [[SDL_RWFromFile]]() will look into expansion files after a given relative path was not found in the internal storage and assets.

By default this hint is not set and the APK expansion files are not searched.


== Version ==
This hint is available since SDL 2.0.4.
