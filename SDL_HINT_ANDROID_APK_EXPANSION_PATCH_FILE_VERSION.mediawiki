|}

<!-- #Leave this section as-is unless you have a code example to put in.  In that case, replace You can add your code example here with your code example following the Style Guide instructions.  Leave the rest of the markup alone and delete this comment. -->


== Remarks ==
This hint must be set together with the hint [[SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION]].

If both hints were set then [[SDL_RWFromFile]]() will look into expansion files after a given relative path was not found in the internal storage and assets.

By default this hint is not set and the APK expansion files are not searched.


== Version ==
This hint is available since SDL 2.0.4.
