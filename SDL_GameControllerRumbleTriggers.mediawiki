= SDL_GameControllerRumbleTriggers =

Start a rumble effect in the game controller's triggers.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GameControllerRumbleTriggers(SDL_GameController *gamecontroller, Uint16 left_rumble, Uint16 right_rumble, Uint32 duration_ms);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''gamecontroller'''
|The controller to vibrate
|-
|'''left_rumble'''
|The intensity of the left trigger rumble motor, from 0 to 0xFFFF
|-
|'''right_rumble'''
|The intensity of the right trigger rumble motor, from 0 to 0xFFFF
|-
|'''duration_ms'''
|The duration of the rumble effect, in milliseconds
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0, or -1 if trigger rumble isn't supported on this controller

== Remarks ==

Each call to this function cancels any previous trigger rumble effect, and
calling it with 0 intensity stops any rumbling.

Note that this is rumbling of the _triggers_ and not the game controller as
a whole. This is currently only supported on Xbox One controllers. If you
want the (more common) whole-controller rumble, use
[[SDL_GameControllerRumble]]() instead.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
