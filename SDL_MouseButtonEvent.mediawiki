== Remarks ==
[[SDL_MouseButtonEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP is reported.  You would access it through the event's <code>button</code> field.

An SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN or SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP event occurs whenever a user presses or releases a button on a mouse.

'''button''' may be one of:
{|
|SDL_BUTTON_LEFT
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_MIDDLE
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_X1
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_X2
|}

'''which''' may be SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID, for events that were generated by a touch input device, and not a real mouse. You might want to ignore such events, if your application already handles [[SDL_TouchFingerEvent]].
