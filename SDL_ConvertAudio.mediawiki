= SDL_ConvertAudio =
Use this function to convert audio data to a desired audio format.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_ConvertAudio (SDL_AudioCVT * cvt)
```

== Function Parameters ==

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 if the conversion was completed successfully, otherwise -1 is returned.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
Once you have initialized the \c cvt structure using [[SDL_BuildAudioCVT]](), created an audio buffer \c cvt->buf, and filled it with \c cvt->len bytes of audio data in the source format, this function will convert it in-place to the desired format.

The data conversion may expand the size of the audio data, so the buffer \c cvt->buf should be allocated after the \c cvt structure is initialized by [[SDL_BuildAudioCVT]](), and should be \c cvt->len*cvt->len_mult bytes long.

If the conversion completed successfully then the converted audio data can be read from cvt->buf. The amount of valid, converted, audio data in the buffer is equal to cvt->len*cvt->len_ratio.
