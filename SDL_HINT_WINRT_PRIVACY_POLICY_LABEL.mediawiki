= SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL =
A hint that specifies a label text for a WinRT app's privacy policy link.




== Values ==
{|
|X
|a label text for a WinRT app's privacy policy link
|}


== Default ==
By default this hint's value is "Privacy Policy".



== Remarks ==
Network-enabled WinRT apps must include a privacy policy.  On Windows 8, 8.1, and RT, Microsoft mandates that this policy be available via the Windows Settings charm.  SDL provides code to add a link there, with its label text being set via the optional hint, SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL.

Please note that a privacy policy's contents are not set via this hint.  A separate hint, [[SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL]], is used to link to the actual text of the policy.

The contents of this hint should be encoded as a UTF8 string.

The default value is "Privacy Policy".  This hint should only be set during app initialization, preferably before any calls to [[SDL_Init]]().

For additional information on linking to a privacy policy, see the documentation for [[SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL]].


== Version ==
This hint is available since SDL 2.0.3.
