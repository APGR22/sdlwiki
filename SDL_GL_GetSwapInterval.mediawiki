Use this function to get the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GL_GetSwapInterval(void)
```

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 if there is no vertical retrace synchronization, 1 if the buffer swap is synchronized with the vertical retrace, and -1 if late swaps happen immediately instead of waiting for the next retrace; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==
If the system can't determine the swap interval, or there isn't a valid current context, this function will return 0 as a safe default.
