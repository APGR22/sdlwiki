= SDL_AudioFormat =
A typedef that contains audio format flags.


== Values ==
These are what the 16 bits in [[SDL_AudioFormat]] currently mean:
```
++-----------------------sample is signed if set
||
||       ++-----------sample is bigendian if set
||       ||
||       ||          ++---sample is float if set
||       ||          ||
||       ||          || +---sample bit size---+
||       ||          || |                     |
15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00 
```
''OR''
{|

|sample is bigendian if set

Unspecified bits are always zero.  There are macros in SDL 1.3 and later to query these bits.
