= SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds =
Use this function to get the usable desktop area represented by a display, with the primary display located at 0,0.




== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds(int       displayIndex,
                               SDL_Rect* rect)
```


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''displayIndex'''
|the index of the display to query the usable bounds from
|-
|'''rect'''
|the [[SDL_Rect]] structure filled in with the display bounds
|}


== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.


== Code Examples ==
```c++

== Remarks ==
This is the same area as [[SDL_GetDisplayBounds]]() reports, but with portions reserved by the system removed. For example, on Apple Mac OS X, this subtracts the area occupied by the menu bar and dock.

Setting a window to be fullscreen generally bypasses these unusable areas, so these are good guidelines for the maximum space available to a non-fullscreen window.

The parameter '''rect''' is ignored if it is NULL.

This function also returns -1 if the parameter '''displayIndex''' is out of range.


== Version ==
This function is available in ''unstable'' versions newer than (stable) SDL 2.0.4.
