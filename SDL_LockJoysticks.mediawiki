= SDL_LockJoysticks =

Locking for multi-threaded access to the joystick API 

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_LockJoysticks(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

If you are using the joystick API or handling events from multiple threads
you should use these locking functions to protect access to the joysticks.

In particular, you are guaranteed that the joystick list won't change, so
the API functions that take a joystick index will be valid, and joystick
and game controller events will not be delivered.
