= Contributing =

We are very pleased that you are interested in contributing!  

Our goal is to create the best documentation for SDL possible.  To this end we have adopted the following guiding principles and would appreciate your keeping them in mind as you create your contributions.
: This wiki should:
* have a consistent look and feel throughout
* be easy to use
* be accurate
* contain high quality information
* be as simple and straight forward as possible

To help you with this we have created a series of resources:

<span id="form"></span>
=== Feedback Form ===
: This is the quickest and simplest way to contribute!  Every page of the wiki contains a drop down ''Feedback'' form (upper right) where you can post quick content ideas, questions, suggestions, etc.  Simply click the form tab, fill in the text field with your contribution, and click ''Submit''.  We'll take it from there!

<span id="list"></span>
=== Mailing List ===
: The [http://lists.libsdl.org/listinfo.cgi/docs-libsdl.org Documentation Mailing List] has been set up to allow users to share documentation-related topics.  Anything from conventions to needed content, questions or comments, can be posted to the Mailing List.  Plus, keep up with what others are saying and doing on the wiki.  

: We encourage all contributors to join the mailing list and participate in the discussions there.  It is a great place to discuss areas that need contributions and to let others know what you are working on or if you are able to help address a request.

<span id="guides"></span>
=== Style Guides by Topic ===
: These are the core of our contribution resources.  There is a style guide for each type of contribution you may wish to make as well as the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] guide which contains global information that all contributors should have.  

: '''We recommend that you begin with Wiki Basics and then dive into the topic-specific guides that interest you before you begin to edit.'''  Please check back periodically for reminders and updates!
