SDL_DisplayMode* SDL_GetClosestDisplayMode(const SDL_DisplayMode* mode,
                                           SDL_DisplayMode*       closest)
```

|'''mode'''
|the desired display mode
|-

== Remarks ==
The available display modes are scanned, and '''closest''' is filled in with the closest mode matching the requested mode and returned. The mode format and refresh_rate default to the desktop mode if they are 0. The modes are scanned with size being first priority, format being second priority, and finally checking the refresh_rate. If all the available modes are too small, then NULL is returned.
