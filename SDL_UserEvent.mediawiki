= SDL_UserEvent =
A structure that contains an application-defined event type.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|SDL_USEREVENT through SDL_NUMEVENTS-1
|-
|Uint32
|'''windowID'''
|the associated window, if any
|-
|Sint32
|'''code'''
|user defined event code
|-
|void*
|'''data1'''
|user defined data pointer
|-
|void*
|'''data2'''
|user defined data pointer
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_Event event;
SDL_zero(event);
event.type = SDL_USEREVENT;
event.user.code = my_event_code;
event.user.data1 = significant_data;
event.user.data2 = 0;
SDL_PushEvent(&event);
```

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_UserEvent]] is in the '''user''' member of the [[SDL_Event]] union. This event is unique; it is never created by SDL but only by the application. The event can be pushed onto the event queue using [[SDL_PushEvent]](). The contents of the structure members are completely up to the programmer; the only requirement is that '''type''' is a value from SDL_USEREVENT to SDL_NUMEVENTS-1 (inclusive).
