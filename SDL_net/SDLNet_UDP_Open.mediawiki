= SDLNet_UDP_Open =

Open a UDP network socket.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
UDPsocket SDLNet_UDP_Open(Uint16 port);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''port'''
|the UDP port to bind this socket to.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a new UDP socket, ready to communicate.

== Remarks ==

If <code>port</code> is non-zero, the UDP socket is bound to a local port.

The <code>port</code> should be given in native byte order, but is used
internally in network (big endian) byte order, in addresses, etc. This
allows other systems to send to this socket via a known port.

Note that UDP sockets at the platform layer "bind" to a nework port number,
but SDL_net's UDP sockets also "bind" to a "channel" on top of that, with
[[SDLNet_UDP_Bind]](). But the term is used for both.

When you are done communicating over the returned socket, you can shut it
down and free its resources with [[SDLNet_UDP_Close]]().
