= SDLNet_Linked_Version =

Query the version of SDL_net that the program is linked against.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
const SDLNet_version * SDLNet_Linked_Version(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to the version information.

== Remarks ==

This function gets the version of the dynamically linked SDL_net library.
This is separate from the SDL_NET_VERSION() macro, which tells you what
version of the SDL_net headers you compiled against.

This returns static internal data; do not free or modify it!
