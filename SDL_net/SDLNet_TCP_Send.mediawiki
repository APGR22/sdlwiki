= SDLNet_TCP_Send =

Send data over a non-server socket.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_TCP_Send(TCPsocket sock, const void *data,
        int len);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''sock'''
|the socket to send data to.
|-
|'''data'''
|a pointer to the bytes to send.
|-
|'''len'''
|the number of bytes, pointed to by <code>data</code>, to transmit.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns number of bytes sent, which might be less if there was a problem or
connection failure. If the socket is invalid, this function can return -1,
but in valid uses it'll return >= 0.

== Remarks ==

<code>sock</code> must be a valid socket that was created by
[[SDLNet_TCP_Open]] with a specific address, or [[SDLNet_TCP_Accept]].

This function sends <code>len</code> bytes, pointed to by <code>data</code>
over the non-server socket <code>sock</code>.

This function returns the actual amount of data sent. If the return value
is less than the amount of data sent, then either the remote connection was
closed, or an unknown socket error occurred.
