= SDLNet_Init =

Initialize SDL_net.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_Init(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.

== Remarks ==

You must successfully call this function before it is safe to call any
other function in this library, with one exception: A human-readable error
message can be retrieved from [[SDLNet_GetError]]() when if this function
fails.

SDL must be initialized before calls to functions in this library, because
this library uses utility functions from the SDL library.

It is safe to call this more than once; the library keeps a counter of init
calls, and decrements it on each call to [[SDLNet_Quit]], so you must pair
your init and quit calls.
