====== (This function is part of SDL_net, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= SDLNet_TCP_Open =

Open a TCP network socket.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
TCPsocket SDLNet_TCP_Open(IPaddress *ip);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''ip'''
|The address to open a connection to (or to host a server on).
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the newly created socket, or NULL if there was an error.

== Remarks ==

If <code>ip->host</code> is INADDR_NONE or INADDR_ANY, this creates a local
server socket on the given port, otherwise a TCP connection to the remote
host and port is attempted. The address passed in should already be swapped
to network byte order (addresses returned from [[SDLNet_ResolveHost]]() are
already in the correct form).
