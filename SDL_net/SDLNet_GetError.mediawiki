= SDLNet_GetError =

Get the latest error message from SDL_net.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
const char * SDLNet_GetError(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

The error message, depending on how SDL_net was built, may or may not be
thread-specific. Sometimes things will set an error message when no failure
was reported; the error string is only meaningful right after a public API
reports a failure, and should be ignored otherwise.
