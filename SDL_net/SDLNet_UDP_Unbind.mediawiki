====== (This function is part of SDL_net, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= SDLNet_UDP_Unbind =

Unbind all addresses from the given channel.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDLNet_UDP_Unbind(UDPsocket sock, int channel);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''sock'''
|the UDP socket to unbind addresses from a channel on.
|-
|'''channel'''
|the channel of the socket to unbind.
|}

== Remarks ==

Note that UDP sockets at the platform layer "bind" to a nework port number,
but SDL_net's UDP sockets also "bind" to a "channel" on top of that, with
[[SDLNet_UDP_Bind]](). But the term is used for both.
