= SDLNet_Quit =

Deinitialize SDL_net.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDLNet_Quit(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

You must call this when done with the library, to free internal resources.
It is safe to call this when the library isn't initialized, as it will just
return immediately.

Once you have as many quit calls as you have had successful calls to
[[SDLNet_Init]], the library will actually deinitialize.
