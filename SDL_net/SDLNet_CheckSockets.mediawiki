= SDLNet_CheckSockets =

Check a socket set for data availability.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_CheckSockets(SDLNet_SocketSet set, Uint32 timeout);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''set'''
|the socket set to check for ready sockets.
|-
|'''timeout'''
|the time to wait _in milliseconds_ for new data to arrive. A timeout of zero checks for new data and returns without blocking.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the number of sockets ready for reading, or -1 if there was an
error with the select() system call.

== Remarks ==

This function checks to see if data is available for reading on the given
set of sockets. If 'timeout' is 0, it performs a quick poll, otherwise the
function returns when either data is available for reading, or the timeout
in milliseconds has elapsed, whichever occurs first.
