= SDLNet_ResizePacket =

Reallocate a UDP packet's payload space.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_ResizePacket(UDPpacket *packet, int newsize);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''newsize'''
|the new maximum number of bytes of payload this packet will contain.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the new maximum payload size, which will be unchanged from the
previous if the system ran out of memory.

== Remarks ==

This takes an existing packet and makes sure it can contain at least
<code>newsize</code> bytes of space for payload.

When done with this packet, you can free it with [[SDLNet_FreePacket]].
Packets can be used multiple times; you don't have to allocate a new one
for each piece of data you intend to send.

Please note that on memory allocation failure, this function will leave the
existing buffer alone, and _will return the original buffer size_. It will
not return an error value, it'll just leave the packet as it was!
