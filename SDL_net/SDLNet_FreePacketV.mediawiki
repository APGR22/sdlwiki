====== (This function is part of SDL_net, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= SDLNet_FreePacketV =

Free a UDP packet vector (array of packets).

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDLNet_FreePacketV(UDPpacket **packetV);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''packetV'''
|the results of a call to [[SDLNet_AllocPacketV]]().
|}

== Remarks ==

This frees the results of a previous call to [[SDLNet_AllocPacketV]](),
freeing both the set of packets and the array that holds them.

It is safe to free a NULL array through here; it's a harmless no-op.

You must not use this to free packets allocated through any function other
than [[SDLNet_AllocPacketV]]().
