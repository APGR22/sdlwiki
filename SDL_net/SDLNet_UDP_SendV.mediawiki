= SDLNet_UDP_SendV =

Send a vector of packets to the the channels specified within the packet.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDLNet_UDP_SendV(UDPsocket sock, UDPpacket **packets, int npackets);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns the number of packets successfully sent from this machine.

== Remarks ==

If the channel specified in the packet is -1, the packet will be sent to
the address in the <code>src</code> member of the packet.

Each packet will be updated with the status of the packet after it has been
sent, -1 if the packet send failed.

This function takes an array of packets but does not need to be allocated
through [[SDLNet_AllocPacketV]]; if you supply your own array of packets
you allocated individually, that is okay.
