== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|SDL_QUIT
|}

== Code Examples ==

```

== Remarks ==
*<br/>[[SDL_QuitEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_QUIT is reported.

,,As can be seen, ,,the [[SDL_QuitEvent]] structure serves no useful purpose ^itself^. The event ,,itself,, ^it describes/defines/contains???^, on the other hand, is very important. If you filter out or ignore a quit event then it is impossible for the user to close the window. On the other hand, if you do accept a quit event then the application window will be closed, and screen updates will still report success even though the application will no longer be visible.
 Note: The macro SDL_QuitRequested will return non-zero if a quit event is pending. <br/>*  <<Color2(green,SDL_QuitRequested seems to be a define in quit.h.  Don't see it as a macro.)>>
