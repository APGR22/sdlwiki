= SDL_GetScancodeName =
Use this function to get a human-readable name for a scancode.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
const char* SDL_GetScancodeName(SDL_Scancode scancode)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''scancode'''
|the desired [[SDL_Scancode]] to query
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns a pointer to the name for the scancode. If the scancode doesn't have a name this function returns an empty string ("").

<!-- <span style="color: green;">Should scancode here be bold?  Should the pointer be mentioned?  Any error state?</span> -->

== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
See [[SDL_Scancode]] for details.

/!\ ''Warning'': The returned name is by design not stable across platforms, e.g. the name for SDL_SCANCODE_LGUI is "Left GUI" under Linux but "Left Windows" under Microsoft Windows, and some scancodes like SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSBACKSLASH don't have any name at all.  There are even scancodes that share names, e.g. SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN and SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN2 (both called "Return").  This function is therefore unsuitable for creating a stable cross-platform two-way mapping between strings and scancodes.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
