= SDL_GetScancodeName =

Get a human-readable name for a scancode.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
const char* SDL_GetScancodeName(SDL_Scancode scancode);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''scancode'''
|the desired [[SDL_Scancode]] to query
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns a pointer to the name for the scancode. If the scancode doesn't
have a name this function returns an empty string ("").

== Remarks ==

See [[SDL_Scancode]] for details.

'''Warning''': The returned name is by design not stable across platforms,
e.g. the name for <code>[[SDL_SCANCODE_LGUI]]</code> is "Left GUI" under
Linux but "Left Windows" under Microsoft Windows, and some scancodes like
<code>[[SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSBACKSLASH]]</code> don't have any name at all.
There are even scancodes that share names, e.g.
<code>[[SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN]]</code> and
<code>[[SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN2]]</code> (both called "Return"). This function
is therefore unsuitable for creating a stable cross-platform two-way
mapping between strings and scancodes.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
