Set the window to always be above the others.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>

                              SDL_bool on_top);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|The window of which to change the always on top state

This will add or remove the window's
<code>[[SDL_WINDOW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP]]</code> flag. This will bring the window
