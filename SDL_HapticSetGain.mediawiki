                      int         gain)
```

```

== Remarks ==
Device must support the SDL_HAPTIC_GAIN feature.

The user may specify the ''maximum'' gain by setting the environment variable 
SDL_HAPTIC_GAIN_MAX which should be between 0 and 100. All calls to [[SDL_HapticSetGain]]() will scale linearly using SDL_HAPTIC_GAIN_MAX as the maximum.
