= SDL_JoystickEventState =
Use this function to enable/disable joystick event polling.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_JoystickEventState(int state)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''state'''
|can be one of SDL_QUERY, SDL_ENABLE or SDL_IGNORE
|}
<<Color2(green,Confused - seems like '''state''' should be an integer but these are not integers.  Since RV is also an integer I'm not sure where this info belongs.  Is this an error?)>>

== Return Value ==
Returns ^1 if enabled, 0 if disabled^, or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

*<br/>If '''state''' is SDL_QUERY then the current state is returned, otherwise the new processing state is returned. <br/>*

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
*<br/>This function is used to enable or disable joystick event processing. <br/>*

If joystick events are disabled, you must call [[SDL_JoystickUpdate]]() yourself ,,and,, ^to manually?^ check the state of the joystick when you want joystick information.

*<br/>Note: Joystick event handling is preferred.

Note: Even if joystick event processing is enabled, individual joysticks must be opened before they generate events.

Warning: Calling this function may delete all events currently in SDL's event queue. <br/>*
