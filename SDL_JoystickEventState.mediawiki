= SDL_JoystickEventState =
Use this function to enable/disable joystick event polling.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_JoystickEventState(int state)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''state'''
|can be one of SDL_QUERY, SDL_IGNORE, or SDL_ENABLE
|}
Note: You may use -1, 0, or 1 in place of SDL_QUERY, SDL_IGNORE, or SDL_ENABLE respectively.

== Return Value ==
Returns 1 if enabled, 0 if disabled, or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

If '''state''' is SDL_QUERY then the current state is returned, otherwise the new processing state is returned.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
printf("%i\n", SDL_JoystickEventState(SDL_QUERY));  /* prints 1 */
printf("%i\n", SDL_JoystickEventState(SDL_IGNORE)); /* prints 0 */
printf("%i\n", SDL_JoystickEventState(SDL_QUERY));  /* prints 0 */
```

== Remarks ==
If joystick events are disabled, you must call [[SDL_JoystickUpdate]]() yourself and manually check the state of the joystick when you want joystick information.

Note: It is recommended that you leave Joystick Event Handling enabled.
Warning: Calling this function may delete all events currently in SDL's event queue.
