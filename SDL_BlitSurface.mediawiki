= SDL_BlitSurface =
Use this function to perform a fast blit from the source surface to the destination surface.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_BlitSurface(SDL_Surface* src,
                    SDL_Rect*    srcrect,
                    SDL_Surface* dst,
                    SDL_Rect*    dstrect)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''src'''
|a pointer to the source surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing '''srcrect'''
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|a pointer to the source rectangle / [[SDL_Rect]] to be queried
|-
|'''dst'''
|a pointer to the destination surface / [[SDL_Surface]] containing '''dstrect'''
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|a pointer to the destination rectangle / [[SDL_Rect]] to be filled
|}

== Return Value ==
If the blit is successful it returns 0, otherwise it returns -1 on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

See [[#video|Remarks]] for details if the return value is -2.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This is the public blit function, and it performs rectangle validation and clipping before passing it to [[SDL_LowerBlit]](). <<Color2(green,Does this remark apply only to Upper<code></code>Blit and not to Blit<code></code>Surface?)>>

You should call [[SDL_BlitSurface]]() unless you know exactly how SDL blitting works internally and how to use the other blit functions.

<<Color2(green,The above 2 remarks were re-ordered and have been moved to the top of the section because they seem more appropriately placed there. They were at the bottom in the reverse order.)>>

The blit function should not be called on a locked surface. <<Color2(green,This was listed below the following but seemed more appropriately placed here.)>>

This assumes that the source and destination rectangles are the same size. If either '''srcrect''' or '''dstrect''' are NULL, the entire surface ('''src''' or '''dst''') is copied. The final blit rectangles are saved in '''srcrect''' and '''dstrect''' after all clipping is performed.

<<Color2(green,Should the following go in a code box or is this formatting acceptable? Should \verbatim and \endverbatim be removed?)>>

The blit semantics for surfaces with and without alpha and colorkey are defined as follows:
 \verbatim
 RGBA->RGB:
  SDL_SRCALPHA set:
   alpha-blend (using alpha-channel).
   SDL_SRCCOLORKEY ignored.
  SDL_SRCALPHA not set:
   copy RGB.
   if SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set, only copy the pixels matching the RGB values of the source colour key, ignoring alpha in the comparison.

 RGB->RGBA:
  SDL_SRCALPHA set:
   alpha-blend (using the source per-surface alpha value);
   set destination alpha to opaque.
  SDL_SRCALPHA not set:
   copy RGB, set destination alpha to source per-surface alpha value.
  both:
   if SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set, only copy the pixels matching the source colour key.

 RGBA->RGBA:
  SDL_SRCALPHA set:
   alpha-blend (using the source alpha channel) the RGB values;
   leave destination alpha untouched. [Note: is this correct?]
   SDL_SRCCOLORKEY ignored.
  SDL_SRCALPHA not set:
   copy all of RGBA to the destination.
   if SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set, only copy the pixels matching the RGB values of the source colour key, ignoring alpha in the comparison.

 RGB->RGB:
  SDL_SRCALPHA set:
   alpha-blend (using the source per-surface alpha value).
  SDL_SRCALPHA not set:
   copy RGB.
  both:
   if SDL_SRCCOLORKEY set, only copy the pixels matching the source colour key.
 \endverbatim

<span id="video"></span> If either of the surfaces were in video memory, and the blit returns -2, the video memory was lost, so it should be reloaded with artwork and re-blitted:
 ```
@code
while ( SDL_BlitSurface(image, imgrect, screen, dstrect) == -2 ) {
while ( SDL_LockSurface(image) < 0 )
Sleep(10);
-- Write image pixels to image->pixels --
SDL_UnlockSurface(image);
}
@endcode
```
<<Color2(green,Should @code and @endcode be removed here?)>>

This happens under DirectX 5.0 when the system switches away from your fullscreen application. The lock will also fail until you have access to the video memory again.
