= SDL_SetWindowBordered =

Set the border state of a window.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_SetWindowBordered(SDL_Window * window,
                           SDL_bool bordered);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window of which to change the border state
|-
|'''bordered'''
|[[SDL_FALSE]] to remove border, [[SDL_TRUE]] to add border
|}

== Remarks ==

This will add or remove the window's <code>[[SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS]]</code>
flag and add or remove the border from the actual window. This is a no-op
if the window's border already matches the requested state.

You can't change the border state of a fullscreen window.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
