= SDL_SysWMEvent =
A structure that contains a video driver dependent system event.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|SDL_SYSWMEVENT
|-
|[[SDL_SysWMmsg]]*
|'''msg'''
|driver dependent data, defined in SDL_syswm.h
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This event is disabled by default.  You can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]()

If you want to use this event you should include SDL_syswm.h.

[[SDL_SysWMEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_SYSWMEVENT is reported. You would access it through the event's <code>syswm</code> field. 

*<br/>If you want to obtain system-specific information about the window manager, you can fill in the <code>version</code> member of an [[SDL_SysWMinfo]] structure (details can be found in SDL_syswm.h, ,,which must be included,,) using the [[SDL_VERSION]]() macro found in SDL_version.h, and pass it to the function* ,,[[SDL_GetWMInfo]](),,.  <<Color2(green,I think this function has been replaced by [[SDL_GetWindowWMInfo]]().  Is that right?  Old wiki included)>> ```
int SDL_GetWMInfo(SDL_SysWMinfo *info);
```
