```

== Remarks ==
If you want to use this event, you should include SDL_syswm.h.

*<br/>If you want to obtain system-specific information about the window manager, you can fill in the '''version''' member of an [[SDL_SysWMinfo]] structure (details can be found in SDL_syswm.h, ,,which must be included,,) using the [[SDL_VERSION]]() macro found in SDL_version.h, and pass it to the function* ,,[[SDL_GetWMInfo]](),,.  <<Color2(green,I think this function has been replaced by [[SDL_GetWindowWMInfo]]().  Is that right?  Old wiki included)>> ```
int SDL_GetWMInfo(SDL_SysWMinfo *info);
```
