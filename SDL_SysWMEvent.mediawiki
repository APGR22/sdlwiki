= SDL_SysWMEvent =
A structure that contains a video driver dependent system event.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|SDL_SYSWMEVENT
|-
|Uint32
|'''timestamp'''
|timestamp of the event
|-
|[[SDL_SysWMmsg]]*
|'''msg'''
|driver dependent data, defined in SDL_syswm.h
|}

== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
This event is disabled by default.  You can enable it with [[SDL_EventState]]().  You are encouraged to avoid this if you can find a less platform-specific way to accomplish your goals.

If you want to use this event you should include SDL_syswm.h and have access to the appropriate system headers.

[[SDL_SysWMEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_SYSWMEVENT is reported. You would access it through the event's <code>syswm</code> field. 

If you want to obtain system-specific information about the window manager you can fill in the <code>version</code> member of an [[SDL_SysWMinfo]] structure using the [[SDL_VERSION]]() macro found in SDL_version.h, and pass it to the function [[SDL_GetWindowWMInfo]]().
