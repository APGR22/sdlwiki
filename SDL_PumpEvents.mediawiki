```

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This function updates the event queue and internal input device state.

This should only be run in the thread that sets the video mode.  <<Color2(green,Is this a serious enough note that it should have an icon to emphasize it?)>>

*<br/>[[SDL_PumpEvents]]() gathers all the pending input information from devices and places it on the event queue. Without calls to [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() no events would ever be placed on the queue. Often the need for calls to [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() is hidden from the user since [[SDL_PollEvent]]() and [[SDL_WaitEvent]]() implicitly call [[SDL_PumpEvents]](). However, if you are not polling or waiting for events (e.g. you are filtering them), then you must call [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() to force an event queue update.<br/>*
