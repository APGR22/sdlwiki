= SDL_FreeRW =
Use this function to free an SDL_RWops structure allocated by [[SDL_AllocRW]]().


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_FreeRW(SDL_RWops* area)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''area'''
|the SDL_RWops structure to be freed
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
/* this would be your RWops implementation's "close" method. */
void close_my_rwops(SDL_RWops *rw)
{
    if(rw != NULL) {
        /* close any other resources. */
        SDL_FreeRW(rw);
    }
}
```

== Remarks ==
Applications do not need to use this function unless they are providing their own RWops implementation. If you just need a RWops to read/write a common data source, you should use the built-in implementations in SDL, like [[SDL_RWFromFile]]() or [[SDL_RWFromMem]](), etc, and call the '''close''' method on those SDL_RWops pointers when you are done with them.

Only use [[SDL_FreeRW]]() on pointers returned by [[SDL_AllocRW]](). The pointer is invalid as soon as this function returns. Any extra memory allocated during creation of the RWops is not freed by [[SDL_FreeRW]](); the programmer must be responsible for managing that memory in their '''close''' method.
