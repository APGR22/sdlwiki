== Remarks ==
This struct is exclusively for the SDL_HAPTIC_RAMP effect.

The ramp effect starts at '''start''' strength and ends at '''end''' strength. It augments in linear fashion. If you use attack and fade with a ramp ''the'' effects get added to the ramp effect making the effect become quadratic instead of linear.
