{|
|'''window'''
|the window that should get the input focus
|}


== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

You almost certainly want [[SDL_RaiseWindow]]() instead of this function. Use this with caution, as you might give focus to a window that is completely obscured by other windows.
