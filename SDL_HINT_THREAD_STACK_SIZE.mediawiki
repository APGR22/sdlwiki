= SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE =
A hint that specifies a variable specifying SDL's threads stack size in bytes or "0" for the backend's default size.




== Values ==
{|
|0
|use the backend's default threads stack size
|-
|X
|use the provided positive threads stack size
|}


== Default ==
By default the backend's default threads stack size is used.



== Remarks ==
Use this hint in case you need to set SDL's threads stack size to other than the default. This is specially useful if you build SDL against a non glibc libc library (such as musl) which provides a relatively small default thread stack size (a few kilobytes versus the default 8 MB glibc uses).

Support for this hint is currently available only in the pthread, Windows (>= SDL 2.0.5), and PSP (>= SDL 2.0.5) backend.

== Version ==

This hint is available since SDL 2.0.4.
