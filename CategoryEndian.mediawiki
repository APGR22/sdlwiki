== Introduction ==
This category contains functions for reading and writing endian-specific values.

Endianness comes in two forms - big and little.  
* SDL_LIL_ENDIAN means byte order is 1234, where the smaller (little) numbered position comes first
* SDL_BIG_ENDIAN means byte order is 4321, where the larger (big) numbered position comes first

: ''Example:''
   ```
2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7   (a stored value)
|
4 bits
|_|
8 bits = 1 byte
|_| |_| |_| |_|
 A   B   C   D  (4 bytes; A = lowest address)
|_____________|
    32 bits

/* When the value is read out of memory as a little-endian value it will produce: */
87654321
/* When the value is read out of memory as a big-endian value it will produce: */
21436587
```



SDL byte order corresponds to the byte order used by the processor type it was compiled for.
* SDL byte order is SDL_LIL_ENDIAN for x86, x64, and similar systems that use the little endian byte order.
* SDL byte order is SDL_BIG_ENDIAN for Mac, PowerPC, and similar systems that use the big endian byte order.
