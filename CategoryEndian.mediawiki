== Introduction ==
This category contains functions for reading and writing endian-specific values.

Endianness comes in two forms - big and little.  
* SDL_LIL_ENDIAN means byte order is 1234, where the smaller (little) numbered position comes first
* SDL_BIG_ENDIAN means byte order is 4321, where the larger (big) numbered position comes first
