== Introduction ==
This category contains functions for reading and writing endian-specific values.

Endianness comes in two forms - big and little.  
* SDL_LIL_ENDIAN means byte order is 1234, where the smaller (little) numbered position comes first
* SDL_BIG_ENDIAN means byte order is 4321, where the larger (big) numbered position comes first

SDL byte order corresponds to the byte order used by the processor type it was compiled for.
* SDL byte order is SDL_LIL_ENDIAN for x86, x64, and similar systems that use the little endian byte order.
* SDL byte order is SDL_BIG_ENDIAN for Mac, PowerPC, and similar systems that use the big endian byte order.
