====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_RenderCopyEx =

Copy a portion of the texture to the current rendering, with optional rotation and flipping.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_RenderCopyEx(SDL_Renderer * renderer,
                   SDL_Texture * texture,
                   const SDL_Rect * srcrect,
                   const SDL_Rect * dstrect,
                   const double angle,
                   const SDL_Point *center,
                   const SDL_RendererFlip flip);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|the rendering context
|-
|'''texture'''
|the source texture
|-
|'''srcrect'''
|the source [[SDL_Rect]] structure or NULL for the entire texture
|-
|'''dstrect'''
|the destination [[SDL_Rect]] structure or NULL for the entire rendering target
|-
|'''angle'''
|an angle in degrees that indicates the rotation that will be applied to dstrect, rotating it in a clockwise direction
|-
|'''center'''
|a pointer to a point indicating the point around which dstrect will be rotated (if NULL, rotation will be done around <code>dstrect.w / 2</code>, <code>dstrect.h / 2</code>)
|-
|'''flip'''
|a [[SDL_RendererFlip]] value stating which flipping actions should be performed on the texture
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

Copy a portion of the texture to the current rendering target, optionally
rotating it by angle around the given center and also flipping it
top-bottom and/or left-right.

The texture is blended with the destination based on its blend mode set
with [[SDL_SetTextureBlendMode]]().

The texture color is affected based on its color modulation set by
[[SDL_SetTextureColorMod]]().

The texture alpha is affected based on its alpha modulation set by
[[SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod]]().

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
