= SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp =
Use this function to get the gamma ramp for the display that owns a given window.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp(SDL_Window* window,
                           Uint16*     red,
                           Uint16*     green,
                           Uint16*     blue)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window used to select the display whose gamma ramp will be queried
|-
|'''red'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities filled in with the translation table for the red channel, or NULL
|-
|'''green'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities filled in with the translation table for the green channel, or NULL
|-
|'''blue'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities filled in with the translation table for the blue channel, or NULL
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==
Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the gamma ramp of the entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display can be retrieved using [[SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex]]().)
