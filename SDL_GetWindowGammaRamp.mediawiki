====== (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! SDL2 is the current stable version!) ======
= SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp =

Get the gamma ramp for a given window's display.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp(SDL_Window * window,
                           Uint16 * red,
                           Uint16 * green,
                           Uint16 * blue);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''window'''
|the window used to select the display whose gamma ramp will be queried
|-
|'''red'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities filled in with the translation table for the red channel, or NULL
|-
|'''green'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities filled in with the translation table for the green channel, or NULL
|-
|'''blue'''
|a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities filled in with the translation table for the blue channel, or NULL
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Remarks ==

Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the gamma ramp of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be
owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of
this display can be retrieved using [[SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex]]().)

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
