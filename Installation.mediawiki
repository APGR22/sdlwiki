= Installing SDL =

(This page is a work in progress.)


How to install SDL varies depending on your platform.

SDL 1.2 isn't covered here. It can be installed on legacy platforms that SDL2 doesn't support, such as Mac OS 9 or OS/2, but settling for 1.2 would not be a drop-in replacement for 2.0. Most of these installation instructions happen to work with 1.2, however, on the platforms we cover.

== Static linking ==

SDL 2.0, unlike 1.2, uses the zlib license (see FAQLicensing), which means you can build a static library linked directly to your program, or just compile SDL's C code directly as part of your project. You are completely allowed to do that. However, we encourage you to ''not'' do this for various technical and moral reasons, and won't cover the details of how to in this document.

== Supported platforms ==

=== Linux/Unix ===

Several other platforms will be built "the Unix way," so we'll describe this platform first.

SDL supports most popular flavors of Unix: Linux, the various BSDs, Solaris, and other things like them.

First! Do you need to compile SDL yourself? It's possible your distribution's package manager already did it for you!

Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) can simply do "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0" to get the library installed system-wide, and all sorts of other useful dependencies, too. "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev" will install everything necessary to build programs that use SDL. Please see docs/README-linux.md in SDL's source code for a more complete discussion of packages involved.

Red Hat-based systems (including Fedora) can simply do "sudo yum install SDL2" to get the library installed system-wide, or "sudo yum install SDL2-devel" to get headers and other build requirements ready for compiling your own SDL programs.

Gentoo users can "sudo emerge libsdl2" to get everything they need.


If you're compiling SDL yourself, here's what we refer to as "the Unix way" of building:
* Get a copy of the source code, either from Mercurial or an official tarball or whatever.
* Make a separate build directory (SDL will refuse to build in the base of the source tree).
* Run the configure script to set things up.
* Run "make" to compile SDL.
* Run "make install" to install your new SDL build on the system.

This looks something like this:

```
hg clone https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install
```

The last command says "sudo" so we can write it to /usr/local (by default). You can change this to a different location with the --prefix option to the configure script. In fact, there are a LOT of good options you can use with configure! Be sure to check out its --help option for details. SDL tries to do the right thing by default, though, so you can usually get away with no options at all.

An (experimental!) alternative to the configure script is the CMake project file. It works on similar principles to the configure script, but you might find that you enjoy it more, if this is the sort of thing you generally enjoy in the first place. Driving that is left as an exercise for the reader.

Once you have the library installed, you can use the sdl2-config program to help you compile your own code:

    ```gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c <code>sdl2-config --cflags --libs</code>```

=== Windows ===

SDL currently provides Visual Studio project files for Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013 in various flavors, and the CMake files can often generate project files for other Windows compilers.

!!! WRITE ME cygwin, mingw64, cmake, buildbot pregenerated builds, etc.

=== Mac OS X ===

You can build for Mac OS X "the Unix way" with the configure or CMake scripts, and Xcode projects are also provided. You can ship an SDL.framework, or just build the .dylib file and ship it with an appropriate install_name to ship beside your program's binary.

== Not supported ==

If your favorite system is listed here, we aren't working on it. If you send reasonable patches, we are happy to take a look, though! SDL 1.2's API and feature set is different than SDL 2 (dramatically different in some cases), but it's possible that 1.2 still supports these systems.

=== Consoles (PlayStation, XBox, Wii, etc) ===

SDL2 does not currently support these platforms, but we'd really like to! If you work for Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo, we would like to port SDL2 to these platforms and provide support to registered developers in a separate repository. Please get in touch with us!

=== BeOS ===

This probably works, or could be made to work, using the Haiku target, but there are no plans to do so. SDL 1.2 still supports BeOS.

=== Nintendo DS ===

This worked at some point using a homebrew toolkit, but we removed it due to bitrot. There's some rudimentary support in SDL 1.2.

=== Sony PSP ===

This worked at some point using a homebrew toolkit, and while it is currently still in the source tree, no one is working on it. 1.2 did not support the PSP either.

=== Mac OS 9 ("Mac OS Classic") ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0. SDL 1.2 still supports Mac OS Classic.

=== IBM OS/2 and eComStation ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0. SDL 1.2 still supports OS/2.

=== Windows 95/98/ME ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0 (Windows XP and later are supported). SDL 1.2 still supports Win9x.

=== QNX ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0. SDL 1.2 still supports QNX.

=== AmigaOS and MorphOS ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0 (and later versions of 1.2, too). There are forks of SDL 1.2 that support them, though.

=== Dreamcast ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0. SDL 1.2 had homebrew support for the Dreamcast.

=== Atari MiNT ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0. SDL 1.2 still supports it.

=== Symbian ===

Support was removed in SDL 2.0. SDL 1.2 still supports it.
