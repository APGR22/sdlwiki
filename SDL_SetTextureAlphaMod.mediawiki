= SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod =
Use this function to set an additional alpha value multiplied into render copy operations.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod(SDL_Texture* texture,
                           Uint8        alpha)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''texture'''
|the texture to update
|-
|'''alpha'''
|the source alpha value multiplied into copy operations
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>

</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
When this texture is rendered, during the copy operation the source alpha value is modulated by this alpha value according to the following formula:
 <code>srcA = srcA * (alpha / 255)</code>

Alpha modulation is not always supported by the renderer; it will return -1 if alpha modulation is not supported.
