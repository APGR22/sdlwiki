= SDL_AudioStreamFlush =

Tell the stream that you're done sending data, and anything being buffered should be converted/resampled and made available immediately.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int SDL_AudioStreamFlush(SDL_AudioStream *stream);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==

It is legal to add more data to a stream after flushing, but there will be
audio gaps in the output. Generally this is intended to signal the end of
input, so the complete output becomes available.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.7.
