Use this function to create [[SDL_RWops]] structures from <<Color2(green,an FP (a floating-point)???)>>.


== Syntax ==
```c++
#ifdef HAVE_STDIO_H
SDL_RWops* SDL_RWFromFP(FILE*    fp,
                        SDL_bool autoclose)
#else
SDL_RWops* SDL_RWFromFP(void*    fp,
                        SDL_bool autoclose)
#endif
```
