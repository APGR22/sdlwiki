= Style Guide: Function Pages =
This guide provides specific instructions for editing or adding your own content to each section of the Function pages in this wiki.


<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
'''Function pages should provide basic information about the SDL functions to allow users to most effectively utilize them in their projects.'''

Please observe the following for all function pages:  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.

* Sections other than Code Examples and Remarks should have adequate details to make them clear and useful while remaining brief wherever possible.  Code Examples and Remarks may be more extensive, as necessary.

* Please remember to keep it accurate, simple, and easy to understand.

* Do not remove, modify, or add section headings unless specifically mentioned below.

For assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
== Editing Specific Sections ==
=== Title ===
'''''Do not edit the Title.'''''

The Title section consists of the page heading ```= SDL_FunctionName =``` and should match the address of the page and the function described on the page.

If you believe a change is necessary please contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Description ===
The Description section immediately follows the page title and does not have it's own heading.

All function descriptions begin with:
 ```Use this function to```
: followed by a ''clear and concise'' description of what the function does.  

''Note'': Information presented in this section is meant to be limited.  Extended description information for more complicated functions should be placed in the [[#Remarks|Remarks]] section instead.  

<<Color2(red,''Important!'')>> Do not create a link to the Remarks section in the description if additional information is located there.  (See the above ''Note''.)

{|
|<( 30%>''If'' __another API page__ is referenced in the description
|''Action'': As always,  be sure to [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink] it and use () outside the link markup if it is a function.
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' __a parameter__ on that page is referenced in the description
|''Action'': Use '''[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold]''' for the parameter name.
|-
|''Note'': This is a very rare occurrence.
|-
|''Note'': If the reference is to the parameter as a ''concept'' (ie: the window) rather than ''directly'' to the parameter itself (ie: window) do not make it bold.<br/>~-Please don't just make the word bold every time it occurs on the page.-~
|}




~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Table of Contents ===
'''''Do not edit the Table of Contents.'''''

The Table of Contents consists of the following markup and is generated automatically on the parsed page.
 ```<<TableOfContents()>>```

If you believe a change is necessary please contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Syntax ===
The Syntax section consists of a code box that displays the basic components of the function using some specific formatting conventions.  Please apply the following conventions when editing this section.

The basic format is as follows:
```{
{{{#!highlight cpp
returnType* SDL_FunctionName(type1  parameter1,
                             type2* parameter2,
                             ...
                             typeN  parameterN)
```
}}}}

<<Color2(red,''Important!'')>> All types and parameters should be vertically aligned.
* Spacing for parameter __types__ is left-aligned to the type on the first line.
* Spacing for __parameters__ is left-aligned to the longest param type so that there is only 1 space between the longest type (with any pointers) and its parameter. 
* __Pointers__ (*, **) should be aligned next to the types (no space between) and should have at least one space following.

''Markup'': Use spaces as necessary to create the correct alignment.  Within a code box spacing is fixed-width.

''Note'': __To be omitted__
* All additional text that may be found in the header or elsewhere, such as extern, SDLCALL, etc.
* The space between <code>SDL_FunctionName</code> and (.
* Ending semi-colon (;)

''Note'': __To be included__
* A space between <code>returnType</code> and <code>SDL_FunctionName</code>
* Commas at the end of each line if there is more than 1 param

''Note'': Do not remove or alter the code box markup surrounding the function syntax.

''Example'': ```{
{{{#!highlight cpp

           1 space      no space  spaces (as needed)
              |             \    |_________|
SDL_AudioSpec* SDL_LoadWAV_RW(SDL_RWops*     src,
                              int            freesrc,
                              SDL_AudioSpec* spec,     <- longest type
                              Uint8**        audio_buf,   sets alignment
                              Uint32*        audio_len)
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||      \       |
      spaces (as needed)          no space  1 space
```
}}}}



~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Function Parameters ===
The Function Parameters section provides basic information about each parameter in the function and is presented in table format.

The basic format is as follows:

```
||'''parameter1'''||description||
||'''parameter2'''||description||
||'''parameterN'''||description||
```

* The __first column__ contains all of the parameter names, without types or pointers, in bold.
* The __second column__ contains a simple description of each parameter using some specific formatting conventions.
: ''<<Color2(red,Important!)>>'' All descriptions begin with a ''lower case'' letter, end ''without'' a period, and are generally not complete sentences.
* There are a few content-dependent conventions we have chosen for consistency across pages - see the table below for details. 

''Markup'': Use [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Tables basic table markup] and enclose each parameter name in [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold] markup.

''Example'': [[SDL_SetColorKey]]()

{|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Content-dependent formatting''
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' __more than one statement__ must be included in the description
|''Action'': Separate them with a semi-colon (;)
|-
|''Note'': This should be avoided whenever possible.  See the next ''If'' statement in this table for more information.
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' a __more detailed description__ is required to adequately explain a parameter
|''Action 1'' : Appended the following, verbatim, to the end of the brief description<br/>```; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details```
|-
|''Action 2'': Place the more detailed information in the [[#Remarks|Remarks]] section
|-
|''Action 3'': See the next ''If'' in this table
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' the __Remarks section is large__
|''Action 1'': Create an [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Anchors anchor] immediately before the additional comments you are adding to the Remarks section
|-
|''Action 2'': Modify the Remarks link in the parameter description (see ''Action 2'' above) to the following:<br/>```; see [[#anchorname|Remarks]] for details```<br/>where <code>anchorname</code> matches the name you chose for the anchor in ''Action 1''.
|-
|''Markup'': Use ```<span id="anchorname"></span>``` to create the anchor in the Remarks section. See [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Anchors Anchors] for details.
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' __there is a pointer__ associated with the parameter
|''Action'': Avoid mentioning pointers unless they are critical to understanding the parameter or there is little other way to describe it (ie: void*)
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_SetColorKey]]()
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' a pointer points to __something that is filled in by the function__
|''Action'': Use the phrase <code>filled in with</code> in the description
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_QueryTexturePixels]]()
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' the description mentions __a structure that has a page__
|''Action'': Use the following pattern to describe the parameter:<br/><code>The/An</code> ```[[SDL_StructureName]]``` <code>structure representing <some piece of information></code>
|-
|''Note'': Be sure to hyperlink the structure name as shown.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_UnionRect]]()
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the description mentions __a structure that ''does not'' have a page__
|''Action'': Use the plain English term to describe the structure (ie: SDL_Window == window).
|-
|''Note'': These structures may eventually have pages or other references worth linking to, in which case please follow the instructions above for linking to items with pages of their own.
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' a description refers to any other __page in the API__
|''Action'': Create a [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink] to the page.
|-
|''If'' the page is for an __enumeration__ it is not necessary to describe it as an enumeration as above for structures.
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' a description is referring to something that could be __any one of a group of similar items__ (ie: rectangles)
|''Action'': Begin the description with <code>a/an</code>
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_HasIntersection]]()
|-
|''Note'': We realize that this is a somewhat arbitrary distinction depending upon your perspective.  If you are unsure whether to use <code>a/an</code> or <code>the</code> it may be helpful to do a quick text search for other pages with the same or similar parameter and copy the format there.  Ultimately, though, it's not worth losing sleep over. ;) 
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' a description is referring __to a specific item from a group__ (ie: a window)
|''Action'': Begin the description with <code>the</code>
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_BlitScaled]]()
|-
|''Note'': We realize that this is a somewhat arbitrary distinction depending upon your perspective.  If you are unsure whether to use <code>a/an</code> or <code>the</code> it may be helpful to do a quick text search for other pages with the same or similar parameter and copy the format there.  Ultimately, though, it's not worth losing sleep over. ;) 
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' __a parameter__ on that page is referenced in another parameter's description
|''Action'': Use '''[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold]''' for the parameter name.
|-
|''Note'': This is a very rare occurrence.
|-
|''Note'': If the reference is to the parameter as a ''concept'' (ie: the window) rather than ''directly'' to the parameter itself (ie: window) do not make it bold.<br/>~-Please don't just make the word bold every time it occurs on the page.-~

=== Return Value ===
The Return Value section provides basic information about what, if anything, a function will return upon success or failure.  

Most return values follow one of these 2 basic formats, depending upon whether a call to [[SDL_GetError]]() is relevant:
 ```
Returns <something> on success or <something else> on failure.
```
 ''or''
 ```
Returns <something> on success or <something else> on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.
```

Use the following tables to determine what to replace <code><something></code> and <code><something else></code> with in the applicable standard statement or when some other action is required.
{|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''How to use the Options table''
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' a __simple replacement__ is all that is required
|''Action'' will only contain two replacement statements with the top being for success (<code><something></code>) and the bottom being for failure (<code><something else></code>).
|-
|''Example'': If the second column says<br/>''Action'': <code>0</code><br/><code>a negative error code</code><br/>then <code><something></code> should be replaced with the number <code>0</code> and <code><something else></code> should be replaced by the phrase <code>a negative error code</code>.
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' a __complex replacement or other action__ is required
|''Action'' will detail what to do instead.
|}

{|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Options''
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' the return value is __0 or < 0__
|''Action'': <code>0</code><br/><code>a negative error code</code>
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' the return value is __an int other than above__
|''Action'': Replace <code><something></code> and <code><something else></code> with the applicable integers.
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' the return value is __boolean__
|''Action'':<code>SDL_TRUE</code><br/><code>SDL_FALSE</code>
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the return value is __a structure__
|''Action'': Ideally, you would search for other functions using the same return value and replicate the formatting.  If this is not possible the general format will approximate: <code>a/an/the [[SDL_StructureName]] representing...</code> for success.  Failure statement will depend upon what it is.  See other ''If''s for options.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceFrom]]()
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the return value is __void__
|''Action'': Delete the entire Return Value section, including the header.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_FreeSurface]]()
|}
