= SDL_WaitEvent =
Use this function to wait indefinitely for the next available event.


== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_WaitEvent(SDL_Event* event)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''event'''
|the [[SDL_Event]] structure to be filled in with the next event from the queue, or NULL
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns 1 on success or 0 if there was an error while waiting for events; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
If event is not NULL, the next event is removed from the queue and stored in the SDL_Event structure pointed to by event.

As this function implicitly calls [[SDL_PumpEvents]](), you can only call this function in the thread that set the video mode.

As of SDL 2.0, this function does not put the application's process to sleep waiting for events; it polls for events in a loop internally. This may change in the future to improve power savings.
