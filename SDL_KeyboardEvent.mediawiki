== Remarks ==
[[SDL_KeyboardEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] structure and is used when an event of type SDL_KEYDOWN or SDL_KEYUP is reported.

An SDL_KEYDOWN or SDL_KEYUP event occurs whenever a user presses or releases a button on a joystick. The information on what key was pressed or released is in the '''keysym''' member.

Note: Repeating SDL_KEYDOWN events will occur if key repeat is enabled (see SDL_EnableKeyRepeat).  <<Color2(green,SDL_EnableKeyRepeat does not currently have a page and may not exist in SDL 1.3.)>>
