= SDL_GetBasePath =
Use this function to get the directory where the application was run from.  This is where the application data directory is.


== Syntax ==
```c++
char *SDL_GetBasePath(void)
```

== Return Value ==
Returns the an absolute path in UTF-8 encoding do the application data directory. NULL will be returned on error or when the platform doesn't implement this functionality, call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

The return path will be gauranteed to end with a path separator ('\' on Windows, '/' most other platforms)

The pointer returned is owned by you. Please call SDL_free on the pointer when you are done with it. 

== Code Examples ==
```c++

char *data_path = NULL;

int InitializeDataPath() {
    char *base_path = SDL_GetBasePath();
    if (base_path) {
        data_path = SDL_strdup(base_path);
        SDL_free(base_path);
    } else {
        data_path = SDL_strdup("./");
    }
}

```


== Remarks ==

This is not necessarily a fast call, though, so you should call this once near startup and save the string if you need it.
