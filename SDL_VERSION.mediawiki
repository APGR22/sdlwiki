= SDL_VERSION =
<<Color2(green,Should the word "Macro" be in the title above so it is clear that this is not a true function?)>>   ie: SDL_VERSION (Macro)

Use this macro to determine ^the^ SDL version ^a/your^ program was compiled against.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_VERSION(x)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''x'''
|a pointer to an [[SDL_version]] struct to initialize
|}

== Return Value ==
Fills the selected struct with:
: (x)->major = SDL_MAJOR_VERSION
: (x)->minor = SDL_MINOR_VERSION
: (x)->patch = SDL_PATCHLEVEL

== Code Examples ==
<<Include(SDL_GetVersion, , , from="== Code Examples ==", to="== Remarks")>>

== Remarks ==
This macro fills in an [[SDL_version]] structure with the version of the library you compiled against. This is determined by what header the compiler uses. Note that if you dynamically linked the library, you might have a slightly newer or older version at runtime. That version can be determined with [[SDL_GetVersion]]() which, unlike [[SDL_VERSION]](), is not a macro.  

??? This macro gathers information from SDL_MAJOR_VERSION, SDL_MINOR_VERSION, AND SDL_PATCHLEVEL (#defines) and fills the structure [[SDL_version]] with that information. ???
