= SDL_SetAssertionHandler =
Use this function to set an application-defined assertion handler.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_SetAssertionHandler(SDL_AssertionHandler handler,
                             void*                userdata)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''handler'''
|the callback function called when an assertion fails; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''userdata'''
|a pointer passed to the callback as-is
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This function allows an app to show its own assertion UI and/or force the response to an assertion failure. If the app doesn't provide this, SDL will try to do the right thing, popping up a system-specific GUI dialog, and probably minimizing any fullscreen windows.

'''handler''' has the following form:
 ```
SDL_assert_state YourAssertionHandler(const SDL_assert_data* data,
                                      void*                  userdata)
```
: where <code>YourAssertionHandler</code> is the name of your callback function, <code>data</code> is a pointer to the [[SDL_assert_data]] struct corresponding to the current assertion, and <code>userdata</code> is what was passed as '''userdata'''.

:The callback returns an [[SDL_assert_state]] value of how to handle the assertion failure.

<<Color2(green,This seems to be the RV for the callback. Since this function has a void RV.  Should it be listed here anyway?)>>

This callback may fire from any thread, but it runs wrapped in a mutex, so it will only fire from one thread at a time.

Setting the callback to NULL restores SDL's original internal handler.

This callback is NOT reset to SDL's internal handler upon [[SDL_Quit]]()!
