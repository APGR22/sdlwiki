= SDL_SetAssertionHandler =
Use this function to set an application-defined assertion handler.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_SetAssertionHandler(SDL_AssertionHandler handler,
                             void*                userdata)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''handler'''
|the callback function called when an assertion fails or NULL for the default handler; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''userdata'''
|a pointer passed to the callback as-is
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This function allows an application to show its own assertion UI and/or force the response to an assertion failure. If the application doesn't provide this, SDL will try to do the right thing, popping up a system-specific GUI dialog, and probably minimizing any fullscreen windows.

'''handler''' is a callback function of the following form:
 ```
SDL_assert_state YourAssertionHandler(const SDL_assert_data* data,
                                      void*                  userdata)
```
: where <code>YourAssertionHandler</code> is the name of your function, <code>data</code> is a pointer to the [[SDL_assert_data]] struct corresponding to the current assertion, and <code>userdata</code> is what was passed as '''userdata''' to [[SDL_SetAssertionHandler]]().

:This callback should return an [[SDL_assert_state]] value of how to handle the assertion failure.

This callback may fire from any thread, but it runs wrapped in a mutex, so it will only fire from one thread at a time.

This callback is NOT reset to SDL's internal handler upon [[SDL_Quit]]()!
