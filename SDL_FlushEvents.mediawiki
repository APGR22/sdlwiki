= SDL_FlushEvents =
Use this function to clear events from the event queue.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_FlushEvents(Uint32 minType,
                     Uint32 maxType)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''minType'''
|the minimum event type to be cleared; see [[SDL_EventType]] for details
|-
|'''maxType'''
|the maximum event type to be cleared; see [[SDL_EventType]] for details
|}

== Remarks ==
This will unconditionally remove any events from the queue that match the specified type range. If you need to remove a single event type, you can use [[SDL_FlushEvent]]() instead.

It's also normal to just ignore events you don't care about in your event loop without calling this function.

This function only affects currently queued events. If you want to make sure that all pending OS events are flushed, you can call [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() on the main thread immediately before the flush call.
