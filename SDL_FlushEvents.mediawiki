= SDL_FlushEvents =
Use this function to clear events from the event queue.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_FlushEvents(Uint32 minType,
                     Uint32 maxType)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''minType'''
|the minimum event type to be cleared; see [[SDL_EventType]] for details
|-
|'''maxType'''
|the maximum event type to be cleared; see [[SDL_EventType]] for details
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This will unconditionally remove any events from the queue that match the specified type range. If you need to remove a single event type, you can use [[SDL_FlushEvent]]() instead.

It's also normal to just ignore events you don't care about in your event loop without calling this function.
