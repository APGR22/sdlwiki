= SDL_PauseAudioDevice =
Use this function to pause and unpause audio playback on a specified device.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_PauseAudioDevice(SDL_AudioDeviceID dev,
                          int               pause_on)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''dev'''
|the device opened by [[SDL_OpenAudioDevice]]()
|-
|'''pause_on'''
|non-zero to pause, 0 to unpause
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++

```

== Remarks ==
This function pauses and unpauses the audio callback processing. It should be called with '''pause_on'''=0 after opening the specified audio device to start playing sound. This is so you can safely initialize data for your callback function after opening the audio device. Silence will be written to the audio device during the pause.
