= SDL 1.2 to 1.3 Migration Guide =


== Introduction ==

This page describes what changed from SDL 1.2 to SDL 1.3, the new features, and upgrade tips.

== Looking for information ==

The best place for information are:
* this wiki :)
* the tests included in SDL, in the ```test/``` directory ([http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/tip/test browse online])
* the SDL [http://lists.libsdl.org/listinfo.cgi/sdl-libsdl.org mailing list]

== Video ==

=== Hardware surfaces ===

The main change is the separation between software surfaces and hardware (accelerated) surfaces.  Previously both were ```SDL_surface``` structures, and hardware surfaces had the {{{SDL_HWSURFACE}}} flag on.

Now, we have two structures:
* [[SDL_Surface]]: software surfaces, working like in 1.2, but never accelerated
* SDL_Texture: hardware surfaces, whose pixels are not directly accessible (no ```->pixels``` field)

Textures are typically OpenGL textures or X11 pixmaps, stored as near to the graphics hardware as possible.

Textures cannot be blit on each others.  They can be blit to the screen using [[SDL_RenderCopy]].

Textures are created with a [[SDL_TextureAccess]] ```SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STATIC``` or {{{SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING}}}.  Static means the texture doesn't change often, streaming means you can access its pixels using [[SDL_QueryTexturePixels]].  It's used by the SDL engine to manage memory.

Textures may be stored in unaccelerated memory, for instance if there's not enough memory in the graphics card.

=== Screen(s) ===

You now can create multiple screens (for instance: multiple windows). Each window has an associated Renderer. Each Renderer is managed by one of the built-in graphics drivers.

There is a complete example at [[SDL_RenderPresent]].

The renderer replaces your previous ```SDL_Surface *screen``` object.  It has a few methods to draw points, lines, rectangles, blit textures, etc.  It also has a few dedicated post-processors for alpha-blending, masks, as well as add/multiply mode, cf. [[SDL_BlendMode]] and [[SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode]].  Introspection can be achieved using [[SDL_RendererInfo]].

Instead of passing around a pointer to the current screen everywhere in your code, you specify the currently active screen using [[SDL_SelectRenderer]].

You update the physical screen using [[SDL_RenderPresent]], which replaces ```SDL_Flip``` and {{{SDL_UpdateRects}}}.

```SDL_SetVideoMode``` from 1.2 is now just a compatibility function, you will not use it anymore.

=== Alpha-blending ===

Use [[SDL_SetSurfaceAlphaMod]] and [[SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod]] instead of ```SDL_SetAlpha```.

=== Color modulation ===

Some renderer now support a global color alteration (```srcC = srcC * color```), check [[SDL_SetTextureColorMod]] for details.

== Events ==

Events mask are now specified using intervals:

```
# 1.2
SDL_PeepEvents(&event, 1, SDL_GETEVENT, SDL_EVENTMASK(SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN))
```

becomes:

```
# 1.3
SDL_PeepEvents(&event, 1, SDL_GETEVENT, SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN, SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN)
```

== Keys ==

You'll note that there are two kinds of key numbers:
* [[SDLKey]]: key codes, using SDL_Key's SDLK constants; note that SDLK_LAST disappeared, because new values cover most of 32bits. Keys associated with printable characters are compatible with Unicode UTF16.
* [[SDL_scancode]]: scan codes, representing layout-independant key locations

There is now a dedicated API for textual input (e.g. to enter a small text, rather than combining keys); check [[Tutorials/TextInput]] for an introduction.

== Audio ==

Audio is very similar to 1.2.  The driver detection/priority changed, you may need to test again your target configurations.

== CD-ROM ==

CD-ROM support was dropped in 1.3.  There is no replacement.


== Extensions compatibility ==

The official extensions SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer and SDL_net can be compiled with both 1.2 and 1.3.  You may need to download them from the [http://hg.libsdl.org/ mercurial repositories] for the latest fixes.

[http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/ SDL_gfx] can also be compiled with 1.3 starting since 2.0.21 (May 2010).

Changes related to software surfaces manipulation are usually trivial, so more extensions should be rebuildable.

However, this multi-support can lead to delicate situations in the context of shared libraries (when using GNU/Linux distros package dependencies, or when using ms windows .dll's).  For example, if your new 1.3 game links against ```libSDL_image-1.2.so.0```, it will not be able to know whether SDL_image is itself linked against SDL 1.2 or SDL 1.3, especially if SDL_image is provided by the distro and not compiled by you.

== Strategies ==

Here we discuss migration strategies for your code base.

Basic technique: here's how to detect the current SDL version:
```
#if SDL_VERSION_ATLEAST(1,3,0)
/* SDL 1.3 code */
#else
/* SDL 1.2 code */
#endif
```

=== Rewrite ===

The most obvious one: drop SDL 1.2 and rewrite everything for 1.3.

=== Backward-compatibility ===

There are good chances that your current 1.2 code will directly compile under 1.3.  Check ```include/SDL_compat.h``` and  {{{SDL/src/SDL_compat.c}}} to get an idea.

Your code will probably run slower though; in particular there will be no hardware surfaces.

Compatibility is not 100% correct though; for instance ```SDL_SetPalette``` flags are currently ignored.

=== Forward-compatibility ===

You may want to support both libraries, for instance because SDL 1.2 is currently better supported on your platform, or better packaged in GNU/Linux distros.

The !AlienBlaster code, in the Android port repository, uses a few additional functions on top of SDL, that will use either SDL 1.2 or 1.3 seemlessly, and minimise the amount of #ifdef.  It's not completely fool-proof though, for instance blits between hardware surfaces will result in a no-op under 1.3.  Check the C++ code at:
