'''DRAFT'''

= Style Guide: Structure Pages =
This guide provides specific instructions for editing or adding your own content to each section of a Structure page in this wiki.

'''Structure pages should provide basic information about the SDL structures to allow users to most effectively utilize them in their projects.'''


<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
{|
|<<Color2(red,Important note about '''Unions''')>> <br/> The basic structure template is also used for unions that have pages in the wiki.  For simplicity, the following guidelines for structures will also apply to unions unless a specific difference is noted.
|}

'''Please observe the following for all structure pages:'''
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.

* Sections should have adequate details to make them clear and useful while remaining brief wherever possible.  Code Examples and Remarks may be more extensive than other sections if necessary.

* Please remember to keep it accurate, simple, and easy to understand.

* Do not remove, modify, or add to the markup above the page title ~-(processing instructions (ie: <code>#pragma</code>, <code>#acl</code>), <<Color2(red,DRAFT)>> markup, etc.)-~ except:
* On CategoryC<code></code>ompat pages, place the following markup above the page title and below the processing instructions or draft markup, if present:
: ```||<tablewidth="100%" #000000 style="color: #FF8C00;" :> <br/>~+For Backward Compatibility Only+~<br/><br/> ||```

* Do not remove, modify, or add section headings unless specifically mentioned below.

* In general, we prefer that you do not remove or modify existing content unless it is clearly incorrect or out of date.

* Pages with <<Color2(red,DRAFT)>> at the top are in progress and will often contain unusual content, formatting, or notes.  Please do not remove or modify these.  That will all be corrected/removed upon final edit.

For assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
== Editing Specific Sections ==
=== Title ===
'''''Do not edit the Title.'''''

The Title section consists of the page heading and its markup:

 ```= SDL_StructureName =``` 

For structure pages this is the name of the structure being described on the page and should match the address of the page.

''Example'': The page address ```http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SDL_PixelFormat``` should have matching title {{{SDL_PixelFormat}}} and describe the [[SDL_PixelFormat]] structure.

If you believe a change is necessary please submit ''Feedback'' from that page or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Description ===
The Description section immediately follows the page title and does not have it's own heading.

'''Structure descriptions begin with:
 ```A structure that contains```'''
  or very rarely
 ```A union that contains```

: followed by a ''clear and concise'' description of what the structure contains.

<span id="note1"></span>
''Note'': Information presented in this section is meant to be limited.  Extended description information for more complicated structures should be placed in the [[#Remarks|Remarks]] section instead.  
* The Description should not contain a link to the Remarks section even if additional information is located there.

''Note'': Exceptions to the basic description are very unusual.  Follow established patterns in the wiki (based on similar pages which may be found by text search) whenever possible if an exception seems appropriate.  

{|
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the page describes __a union__ rather than a structure
|''Action'': Use the alternate description (<code>A union that contains...</code>) and, if necessary, replace the word <code>structure</code> with the word <code>union</code> where appropriate throughout the page.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_Event]]
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' __another API page__ is referenced in the description
|''Action'': Be sure to [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink] it and use () outside the link markup if it is a function.
|-
|''Example'': ```[[SDL_FunctionName]](), [[SDL_StructureName]]```, [[SDL_GetThreadName]]()
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' __a parameter on that page__ is referenced in the description
|''Action'': Use '''[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold]''' for the parameter name.
|-
|''Note'': This is a very rare occurrence.
|-
|''Note'': If the reference is to the parameter as a ''concept'' (ie: the window to do something with) rather than ''directly'' to the parameter itself (ie: SDL_Function(window)) do not make it bold.<br/>~-Please don't just make the word bold every time it occurs on the page.-~
|}




~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Table of Contents ===
'''''Do not edit the Table of Contents.'''''

The Table of Contents consists of the following markup and is generated automatically on the parsed page.
 ```<<TableOfContents()>>```

If you believe a change is necessary please submit ''Feedback'' from that page or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Data Fields ===
The Data Fields section provides basic information about each field in the structure and is presented in table format.

'''The basic format is as follows:'''
```
||type1||'''field1'''||description||
||type2*||'''field2'''||description||
||[[type3]]||'''field3'''||description||
...
||typeN||'''fieldN'''||description||
```

''Markup'': Use [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Tables basic table markup] and enclose each field name in [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold] markup.  All text in the table is left-justified.

* The __first column__ contains the field type and any pointers if applicable.
* The __second column__ contains the field name, without types or pointers, in bold.
* The __third column__ contains a simple description of each field using some specific formatting conventions.
: ''<<Color2(red,Important!)>>'' All descriptions begin with a ''lower case'' letter, end ''without'' a period, and are generally ''not'' complete sentences.

''Example'': [[SDL_Surface]], [[SDL_JoyButtonEvent]], [[SDL_Palette]], [[SDL_HapticCondition]]

''Action'': There are a few content-dependent conventions we have chosen for consistency across pages.  See the tables below for details. 

{|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED"><span id="general"></span>''General (whole table)''
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' __another API page__ is referenced
|''Action'': Be sure to [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink] it and use () outside the link markup if it is a function.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_Event]], [[SDL_AudioSpec]], [[SDL_SysWMinfo]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' there are __important, distinct groups of fields__ within the structure
|''Action'': Create sections by placing a full-width row with a grey background and centered, italics title above each group.
|-
|''Markup'': Begin the row with empty table cells equal to the number of columns in the table -1 (ie: 2 empty cells for a 3 column table).  Place the following markup in the next cell<br/><code><bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Section Title''</code><br/>Replace <code>Section Title</code> with appropriate text and close the last column.
|-
|''Note'': This is a rare occurrence.  Do not use sections unless they significantly improve the meaning, clarity, or usability of the information.
|-
|''Example'': this table, [[SDL_HapticConstant]], [[SDL_HapticRamp]]
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' the field is __for internal use, deprecated, unused, or read-only__
|''Action'': In addition to the notation (ie: deprecated), make the text in the row grey by including the following, verbatim, in the first cell of the row between the starting table markup and the text:<br/>```<rowstyle="color: #808080;">```
|-
|''Note'': Although a rare case, any other style markup should be included within the same set of angle brackets (<code><></code>) and separated from this markup by a space.
|-
|''Example'': ```
|<rowstyle="color: #808080;">
|type
|'''field'''
|description
|```, [[SDL_Palette]], [[SDL_Color]]
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the structure includes __padding__ fields
|''Action'': Omit all <code>padding</code> fields from the wiki page.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_AudioSpec]], [[SDL_WindowEvent]]
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' there is __a pointer__ associated with the field
|''Action 1'': Place the pointer symbol(s) at the end of the type in the ''first column'' with no space between.
|-
|''Action 2'': In general, avoid mentioning the pointer in the description unless it is necessary to understand the field.
|-
|''Example'': ```
|type*
|...```, [[SDL_Surface]], [[SDL_assert_data]]
|-
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''First Column (type) & Second Column (field)''
|-
|
|<(>There are currently no special formatting instructions just for these columns.  See [[#general|''General'']] above.
|-
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Third Column (description)''
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' __more than one statement__ must be included in the description
|''Action'': Separate them with a semi-colon (;)
|-
|''Note'': This should be avoided whenever possible.  See "''If'' a __[[#detailed|more detailed description]]__ is required to adequately explain a parameter" below for more details.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_JoyButtonEvent]], [[SDL_Keysym]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' a __more detailed description__ is required to adequately explain a field
|<span id="detailed"></span>''Action 1'' : Append the following, verbatim, to the end of the brief description<br/>```; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details```
|-
|''Action 2'': Place the more detailed information in the [[#Remarks|Remarks]] section.
|-
|''Action 3'': See "''If'' the __[[#large|Remarks section is large]]__" below for more details.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_RendererInfo]], [[SDL_HapticEffect]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' the __Remarks section is large__
|<span id="large"></span>''Action 1'': Create an [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Anchors anchor] immediately before the additional comments you are adding to the Remarks section.
|-
|''Markup'': Use ```<span id="anchorname"></span>```, where <code>anchorname</code> is a name of your choosing, to create the anchor in the Remarks section. See [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Anchors Anchors] for details.
|-
|''Action 2'': Modify the Remarks link in the parameter description (see ''Action 1'' in "''If'' a __[[#detailed|more detailed description]]__ is required to adequately explain a parameter" above) to the following:<br/>```; see [[#anchorname|Remarks]] for details```<br/>where <code>anchorname</code> matches the name you chose for the anchor in ''Action 1''.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_RendererInfo]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' __a field references another field__ on that same page
|''Action'': Use '''[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold]''' for the field name.
|-
|''Note'': This is a very rare occurrence.
|-
|''Note'': If the reference is to the field as a ''concept'' rather than ''directly'' to the field itself do not make it bold.<br/>~-Please don't just make the word bold every time it occurs on the page.-~
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_AudioCVT]], [[SDL_HapticCustom]]
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' there is __no relevant description text__
|''Action'': It is acceptable to leave the description cell blank, although it is preferable to put some information there even if it is redundant with the field name or otherwise does not really provide any new information.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_Color]]
|}




~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Code Examples ===
The Code Examples section is meant to contain simple, meaningful examples of how to use the structure in a program.  
* Unlike other sections, which should rarely require editing once DRAFT is removed, this section is ''expected'' to change over time.

This is one of the few sections that is intended to grow and adjust as users discover more information about a structure that would be helpful to share with other users.

For the most part the contents of the Code Examples section will be user-generated and this section will remain as-is until users input their examples.

'''Please see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGCodeExamples Code Examples] Style Guide for details on editing this section.'''


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Remarks ===
The Remarks section is meant to contain additional information that did not fit in the other sections as well as comments regarding the behavior and use of the structure in real-world applications.  
* Unlike other sections, which should rarely require editing once DRAFT is removed, this section is ''expected'' to change over time.

This is one of the few sections that is intended to grow and adjust as users discover more information about how a structure behaves under different circumstances.

For the most part the contents of the Remarks section will be user-generated and this section will remain as-is until users input their comments. 

''Note'': This is __not__ an appropriate place to post questions, suggestions, bugs, or commentary.  Please use the other communication channels available to you, especially the [http://forums.libsdl.org/ forums] and ''Feedback'' form, for these types of remarks.

'''Please see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGRemarks Remarks] Style Guide for details on editing this section.'''


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Related Enumerations ===
The Related Enumerations section provides a list of enumerations specifically referenced by the structure or otherwise ''closely'' related to it.

''Note'': '''In most cases this section will be empty and should be removed from the page.'''

'''This list __should__ include:'''
* enumerations that are specifically referenced in the structure
* enumerations that are indirectly referenced by but closely related to the structure

'''This list __should not__ include:'''
* the primary enumeration on that page
* every other enumeration that might be considered "related" 
: ~-Including too many would make these lists much less valuable.-~
* all enumerations of similar type
* all enumerations of a related category
* enumerations that are indirectly related (ie: it might be common to use them together)
* enumerations that do not have a page in the wiki
* non-enumerations (ie: do not include functions or structures in this list)

''Markup'': Each line should begin with a single blank space and a period followed by the enumeration name enclosed in double brackets to create a [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink].
: ''Note'': Do not include empty parentheses after the name.

: '''The basic format for the Related Enumerations list is:'''
```
== Related Enumerations ==
 .[[SDL_EnumerationName]]
 .[[SDL_EnumerationName]]
```
: ~-''Note'': The heading was included to more clearly illustrate the blank space before the period at the beginning of each list line.  Without this markup the format will not parse correctly.-~

{|
|<( 30%>''If'' there is __more than one enumeration__ in the list
|''Action'': List the enumerations in alphabetical order.
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' there are __no related enumerations__
|''Action'': This section may be removed entirely (including the heading) and added back at a later time if it becomes relevant.
|}

''Example'': [[SDL_Event]], [[SDL_Keysym]], [[SDL_WindowEvent]]


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Related Structures ===
The Related Structures section provides a list of other structures specifically referenced by the structure or otherwise ''closely'' related to it.

''Note'': '''In most cases this section will be empty and should be removed from the page.'''

'''This list __should__ include:'''
* other structures that are specifically referenced in the structure
* other structures that are indirectly referenced by but closely related to the structure

'''This list __should not__ include:'''
* the primary structure on that page
* every other structure that might be considered "related" 
: ~-Including too many would make these lists much less valuable.-~
* all structures of similar type
* all structures of a related category
* structures that are indirectly related (ie: it might be common to use them together)
* structures that do not have a page in the wiki
* non-structures (ie: do not include functions or enumerations in this list)

''Markup'': Each line should begin with a single blank space and a period followed by the structure name enclosed in double brackets to create a [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink].
: ''Note'': Do not include empty parentheses after the name.

: '''The basic format for the Related Structures list is:'''
```
== Related Structures ==
 .[[SDL_StructureName]]
 .[[SDL_StructureName]]
```
: ~-''Note'': The heading was included to more clearly illustrate the blank space before the period at the beginning of each list line.  Without this markup the format will not parse correctly.-~

{|
|<( 30%>''If'' there is __more than one structure__ in the list
|''Action'': List the structures in alphabetical order.
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' there are __no related structures__
|''Action'': This section may be removed entirely (including the heading) and added back at a later time if it becomes relevant.
|}

''Example'': [[SDL_Event]], [[SDL_Color]], [[SDL_HapticDirection]]



~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
<span id="RFs"></span>
=== Related Functions ===
The Related Functions section provides a list of functions specifically associated with that structure or otherwise ''closely'' related to it.
* In general, a "Related Function" is one that __uses the given structure__.

'''This list __should__ include:'''
* functions that use or are otherwise very closely related to the structure

'''This list __should not__ include:'''
* every other function that might be considered "related" 
: ~-Including too many would make these lists much less valuable.-~
* all functions of similar type or action
* all functions of a related category
* functions that are indirectly related (ie: a similar function that does not use the structure)
* functions that do not have a page in the wiki
* non-functions (ie: do not include structures or enumerations in this list)

''Markup'': Each line should begin with a single blank space and a period followed by the function name enclosed in double brackets to create a [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink].
: ''Note'': Do not include empty parentheses after the function names in this section.  They are all functions so it should be understood/unnecessary.

: '''The basic format for the Related Functions list is:'''
```
== Related Functions ==
 .[[SDL_FunctionName]]
 .[[SDL_FunctionName]]
```
: ~-''Note'': The heading was included to more clearly illustrate the blank space before the period at the beginning of each list line.  Without this markup the format will not parse correctly.-~

{|
|<( 30%>''If'' there is __more than one function__ in the list
|''Action'': List the functions in alphabetical order.
|-
|<( 30%>''If'' there are __no related functions__
|''Action'': This section may be removed entirely (including the heading) and added back at a later time if it becomes relevant.
|}

''Example'': [[SDL_TextInputEvent]](), [[SDL_SysWMinfo]]()


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
<span id="footer"></span>
=== Footer ===

The Footer section consists of a horizontal rule followed by two links separated by a comma.  

''Markup'': 
```
----
[[CategoryStruct]], [[CategoryHeader]]
```
: where <code>Categor</code><code>yStruct</code> is the same for every structure page and <code>Categor</code><code>yHeader</code> is structure-specific with <code>Header</code> varying based on the header file containing the structure (see below).

<<Color2(red,''Important!'')>> Category names do not always match the header file name.  Please consult the following [[#CategoryTable|table]] for the correct name to use so the structure will appear in the correct list(s).

''Action 1'': '''Do not edit the <code>Categor</code><code>yStruct</code> link!'''

''Action 2'': '''The ```CategoryHeader``` link may be edited''' ''if'' the page still says {{{[[CategoryHeader]]}}} (as on a new page) or ''if'' the structure has been relocated to another header (very rare).

''<<Color2(red,Important!)>>'' There are a few exceptions to this rule (pages with a category name that does not match their header file).  These have been determined by the SDL team.  Please do not change an existing page's category name simply because it does not match its header file.  If you are concerned that a name is incorrect please submit ''Feedback'' from that page or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>> to confirm the change first.  

''Markup'': Replace <code>Categor</code><code>yHeader</code> with the appropriate category name from the table that follows, or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>> to find out what category name to use if you are unsure or if the category appears to be missing.
