= Style Guide: Structure Pages =
This guide provides specific instructions for editing or adding your own content to each section of a Structure page in this wiki.

'''Structure pages should provide basic information about the SDL structures to allow users to most effectively utilize them in their projects.'''


<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
{|
|<<Color2(red,Important note about '''Unions''')>> <br/> The basic structure template is also used for unions that have pages in the wiki.  For simplicity, the following guidelines for structures will also apply to unions unless a specific difference is noted.
|}

'''Please observe the following for all structure pages:'''
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.

* Sections should have adequate details to make them clear and useful while remaining brief wherever possible.  Code Examples and Remarks may be more extensive than other sections if necessary.

* Please remember to keep it accurate, simple, and easy to understand.

* Do not remove, modify, or add to the markup above the page title ~-(processing instructions (ie: <code>#pragma</code>, <code>#acl</code>), <<Color2(red,DRAFT)>> markup, etc.)-~ except:
* On CategoryC<code></code>ompat pages, place the following markup above the page title and below the processing instructions or draft markup, if present:
: ```||<tablewidth="100%" #000000 style="color: #FF8C00;" :> <br/>~+For Backward Compatibility Only+~<br/><br/> ||```

* Do not remove, modify, or add section headings unless specifically mentioned below.

* In general, we prefer that you do not remove or modify existing content unless it is clearly incorrect or out of date.

* Pages with <<Color2(red,DRAFT)>> at the top are in progress and will often contain unusual content, formatting, or notes.  Please do not remove or modify these.  That will all be corrected/removed upon final edit.

For assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.

<br/>
== Editing Specific Sections ==
=== Title ===
'''''Do not edit the Title.'''''

The Title section consists of the page heading and its markup:

 ```= SDL_StructureName =``` 

For structure pages this is the name of the structure being described on the page and should match the address of the page.

''Example'': The page address ```http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SDL_PixelFormat``` should have matching title {{{SDL_PixelFormat}}} and describe the [[SDL_PixelFormat]] structure.

If you believe a change is necessary please submit ''Feedback'' from that page or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Description ===
The Description section immediately follows the page title and does not have it's own heading.

'''Structure descriptions begin with:
 ```A structure that contains```'''
  or very rarely
 ```A union that contains```

: followed by a ''clear and concise'' description of what the structure contains.

<span id="note1"></span>
''Note'': Information presented in this section is meant to be limited.  Extended description information for more complicated structures should be placed in the [[#Remarks|Remarks]] section instead.  
* The Description should not contain a link to the Remarks section even if additional information is located there.

''Note'': Exceptions to the basic description are very unusual.  Follow established patterns in the wiki (based on similar pages which may be found by text search) whenever possible if an exception seems appropriate.  

{|
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the page describes __a union__ rather than a structure
|''Action'': Use the alternate description (<code>A union that contains...</code>) and, if necessary, replace the word <code>structure</code> with the word <code>union</code> where appropriate throughout the page.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_Event]]
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' __another API page__ is referenced in the description
|''Action'': Be sure to [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink] it and use () outside the link markup if it is a function.
|-
|''Example'': ```[[SDL_FunctionName]](), [[SDL_StructureName]]```
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' __a parameter__ on that page is referenced in the description
|''Action'': Use '''[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold]''' for the parameter name.
|-
|''Note'': This is a very rare occurrence.
|-
|''Note'': If the reference is to the parameter as a ''concept'' (ie: the window to do something with) rather than ''directly'' to the parameter itself (ie: SDL_Function(window)) do not make it bold.<br/>~-Please don't just make the word bold every time it occurs on the page.-~
|}




~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Table of Contents ===
'''''Do not edit the Table of Contents.'''''

The Table of Contents consists of the following markup and is generated automatically on the parsed page.
 ```<<TableOfContents()>>```

If you believe a change is necessary please submit ''Feedback'' from that page or contact us at <<MailTo(ANTI SPAM wiki AT libsdl DOT org)>>.


~-[[#ToC|Return to Table of Contents]]-~
<br/>
<br/>
=== Data Fields ===
The Data Fields section provides basic information about each field in the structure and is presented in table format.

'''The basic format is as follows:'''
```
||type1||'''field1'''||description||
||type2*||'''field2'''||description||
||[[type3]]||'''field3'''||description||
...
||typeN||'''fieldN'''||description||
```

''Markup'': Use [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Tables basic table markup] and enclose each field name in [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold] markup.  All text in the table is left-justified.

* The __first column__ contains the field type and any pointers if applicable.
* The __second column__ contains the field name, without types or pointers, in bold.
* The __third column__ contains a simple description of each field using some specific formatting conventions.
: ''<<Color2(red,Important!)>>'' All descriptions begin with a ''lower case'' letter, end ''without'' a period, and are generally ''not'' complete sentences.

''Example'': [[SDL_Surface]], [[SDL_JoyButtonEvent]], [[SDL_Palette]], [[SDL_HapticCondition]]

''Action'': There are a few content-dependent conventions we have chosen for consistency across pages.  See the tables below for details. 

{|
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED"><span id="general"></span>''General (whole table)''
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' __another API page__ is referenced
|''Action'': Be sure to [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Hyperlinks hyperlink] it and use () outside the link markup if it is a function.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_Event]], [[SDL_AudioSpec]], [[SDL_SysWMinfo]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' there are __important, distinct groups of fields__ within the structure
|''Action'': Create sections by placing a full-width row with a grey background and centered, italics title above each group.
|-
|''Markup'': Begin the row with empty table cells equal to the number of columns in the table -1 (ie: 2 empty cells for a 3 column table).  Place the following markup in the next cell<br/><code><bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Section Title''</code><br/>Replace <code>Section Title</code> with appropriate text and close the last column.
|-
|''Note'': This is a rare occurrence.  Do not use sections unless they significantly improve the meaning, clarity, or usability of the information.
|-
|''Example'': this table, [[SDL_HapticConstant]], [[SDL_HapticRamp]]
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' the field is __for internal use, deprecated, unused, or read-only__
|''Action'': In addition to the notation (ie: deprecated), make the text in the row grey by including the following, verbatim, in the first cell of the row between the starting table markup and the text:<br/>```<rowstyle="color: #808080;">```
|-
|''Note'': Although a rare case, any other style markup should be included within the same set of angle brackets (<code><></code>) and separated from this markup by a space.
|-
|''Example'': ```
|<rowstyle="color: #808080;">
|type
|'''field'''
|description
|```, [[SDL_Palette]], [[SDL_Color]]
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' the structure includes __padding__ fields
|''Action'': Omit all <code>padding</code> fields from the wiki page.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_AudioSpec]], [[SDL_WindowEvent]]
|-
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''First Column (type)''
|-
|<( |2 30%>''If'' there is __a pointer__ associated with the field
|''Action'': Place the pointer symbol(s) at the end of the type with no space between.
|-
|''Example'': ```
|type*
|...```, [[SDL_Surface]], [[SDL_assert_data]]
|-
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Second Column (field)''
|-
|
|<(>There are currently no special formatting instructions just for this column.  See [[#general|''General'']] above.
|-
|
|<bgcolor="#EDEDED">''Third Column (description)''
|-
|<( |3 30%>''If'' __more than one statement__ must be included in the description
|''Action'': Separate them with a semi-colon (;)
|-
|''Note'': This should be avoided whenever possible.  See "''If'' a __[[#detailed|more detailed description]]__ is required to adequately explain a parameter" below for more details.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_JoyButtonEvent]], [[SDL_Keysym]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' a __more detailed description__ is required to adequately explain a field
|<span id="detailed"></span>''Action 1'' : Append the following, verbatim, to the end of the brief description<br/>```; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details```
|-
|''Action 2'': Place the more detailed information in the [[#Remarks|Remarks]] section.
|-
|''Action 3'': See "''If'' the __[[#large|Remarks section is large]]__" below for more details.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_RendererInfo]], [[SDL_HapticEffect]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' the __Remarks section is large__
|<span id="large"></span>''Action 1'': Create an [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Anchors anchor] immediately before the additional comments you are adding to the Remarks section.
|-
|''Markup'': Use ```<span id="anchorname"></span>```, where <code>anchorname</code> is a name of your choosing, to create the anchor in the Remarks section. See [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Anchors Anchors] for details.
|-
|''Action 2'': Modify the Remarks link in the parameter description (see ''Action 1'' in "''If'' a __[[#detailed|more detailed description]]__ is required to adequately explain a parameter" above) to the following:<br/>```; see [[#anchorname|Remarks]] for details```<br/>where <code>anchorname</code> matches the name you chose for the anchor in ''Action 1''.
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_RendererInfo]]
|-
|<( |4 30%>''If'' __a field references another field__ on that same page
|''Action'': Use '''[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics#Text_Formatting bold]''' for the field name.
|-
|''Note'': This is a very rare occurrence.
|-
|''Note'': If the reference is to the field as a ''concept'' rather than ''directly'' to the field itself do not make it bold.<br/>~-Please don't just make the word bold every time it occurs on the page.-~
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_AudioCVT]], [[SDL_HapticCustom]]
