= SDL_GetWindowWMInfo =
Use this function to get driver specific information about a window.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_bool SDL_GetWindowWMInfo(SDL_Window*    window,
                             SDL_SysWMinfo* info)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|^a pointer to^ the window about which information is being requested
|-
|'''info'''
|^a pointer to the [[SDL_SysWMinfo]] structure to query^; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_TRUE if the function is implemented and the <code>version</code> member of the '''info''' struct is valid, or SDL_FALSE if the information could not be retrieved; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information. 

== Code Examples ==
```c++
//You typically use this function like this:
SDL_SysWMinfo info;
SDL_VERSION(&info.version);
if ( SDL_GetWindowWMInfo(&info) ) { ... }
```

<<Color2(green,There is a typo in the header - SysWMInfo should be SysWMinfo. Corrected above already.)>>

== Remarks ==
Include SDL_syswm.h for the declaration of [[SDL_SysWMinfo]].

'''info''' ^requires that^ this structure^, [[SDL_SysWMinfo]],^ must be initialized with the SDL version, and is then filled in with information about the given window.
