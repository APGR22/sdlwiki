= SDL_CreateRGBSurface =
Use this function to allocate a new RGB surface.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Surface* SDL_CreateRGBSurface(Uint32 flags,
                                  int    width,
                                  int    height,
                                  int    depth,
                                  Uint32 Rmask,
                                  Uint32 Gmask,
                                  Uint32 Bmask,
                                  Uint32 Amask)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''flags'''
|the flags are unused and should be set to 0
|-
|'''width'''
|the width of the surface
|-
|'''height'''
|the height of the surface
|-
|'''depth'''
|the depth of the surface in bits; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''Rmask'''
|the red mask for the pixels
|-
|'''Gmask'''
|the green mask for the pixels
|-
|'''Bmask'''
|the blue mask for the pixels
|-
|'''Amask'''
|the alpha mask for the pixels
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns the new [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is created or NULL if it fails; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
    /* Create a 32-bit surface with the bytes of each pixel in R,G,B,A order,
       as expected by OpenGL for textures */
    SDL_Surface *surface;
    Uint32 rmask, gmask, bmask, amask;

    /* SDL interprets each pixel as a 32-bit number, so our masks must depend
       on the endianness (byte order) of the machine */
#if SDL_BYTEORDER == SDL_BIG_ENDIAN
    rmask = 0xff000000;
    gmask = 0x00ff0000;
    bmask = 0x0000ff00;
    amask = 0x000000ff;
#else
    rmask = 0x000000ff;
    gmask = 0x0000ff00;
    bmask = 0x00ff0000;
    amask = 0xff000000;
#endif

    surface = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, width, height, 32,
                                   rmask, gmask, bmask, amask);
    if (surface == NULL) {
        SDL_Log("SDL_CreateRGBSurface() failed: %s", SDL_GetError());
        exit(1);
    }

    /* or using the default masks for the depth: */
    surface = SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0, width, height, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0);
```

== Remarks ==
If '''depth''' is 4 or 8 bits, an empty palette is allocated for the surface. If '''depth''' is greater than 8 bits, the pixel format is set using the [RGBA]mask parameters.

The [RGBA]mask parameters are the bitmasks used to extract that color from a pixel. For instance, '''Rmask''' being FF000000 means the red data is stored in the most  significant byte. Using zeros for the RGB masks sets a default value, based on the depth. (e.g. SDL_CreateRGBSurface(0,w,h,32,0,0,0,0);) However, using zero for the Amask results in an Amask of 0.

By default surfaces with an alpha mask are set up for blending as with
:```SDL_SetSurfaceBlendMode(surface, SDL_BLENDMODE_BLEND)```
You can change this by calling [[SDL_SetSurfaceBlendMode]]() and selecting a different <code>blendMode</code>.
