= SDL_ShowCursor =
Use this function to toggle whether or not the cursor is shown.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int SDL_ShowCursor(int toggle)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''toggle'''
|SDL_ENABLE to show the cursor, SDL_DISABLE to hide it, SDL_QUERY to query the current state
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_ENABLE if the cursor is shown, or SDL_DISABLE if the cursor is hidden, or a negative error code on failure; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.


== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    /* creates a blank cursor */
    SDL_ShowCursor(SDL_DISABLE);
    /* ... */
    return 0;
}
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
The cursor starts off displayed but can be turned off.  Passing SDL_ENABLE displays the cursor and passing SDL_DISABLE hides it.

The current state of the mouse cursor can be queried by passing SDL_QUERY; either SDL_DISABLE or SDL_ENABLE will be returned.

'''toggle''' may be any of the following:
{|
|-1
|SDL_QUERY
|returns the current visibility of the cursor
|-
|0
|SDL_DISABLE
|makes the cursor hidden (also a return value as to the current state of the cursor)
|-
|1
|SDL_ENABLE
|makes the cursor visible (also a return value as to the current state of the cursor)
|}
