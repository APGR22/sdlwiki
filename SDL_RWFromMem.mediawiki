= SDL_RWFromMem =
Use this function to prepare a read-write memory buffer for use with RWops.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_RWops* SDL_RWFromMem(void* mem,
                         int   size)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''mem'''
|a pointer to a buffer to feed an [[SDL_RWops]] stream
|-
|'''size'''
|the buffer size, in bytes
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns a pointer to a new [[SDL_RWops]] structure, or NULL if it fails; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
char bitmap[310000];
SDL_RWops *rw = SDL_RWFromMem(bitmap, sizeof(bitmap));
SDL_SaveBMP_RW(screen, rw, 1);  /* closes RWOPS, leaves us memory buffer of data */
```

== Remarks ==
This function sets up an [[SDL_RWops]] struct based on a memory area of a certain size, for both read and write access.

This memory buffer is not copied by the RWops; the pointer you provide must remain valid until you close the stream. Closing the stream will not free the original buffer.

If you need to make sure the RWops never writes to the memory buffer, you should use [[SDL_RWFromConstMem]] with a read-only buffer of memory instead.
