====== (This function is part of SDL_ttf, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= TTF_SetFontKerning =

Set if kerning is allowed for a font.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void TTF_SetFontKerning(TTF_Font *font, int allowed);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''font'''
|the font to set kerning on.
|-
|'''allowed'''
|non-zero to allow kerning, zero to disallow.
|}

== Remarks ==

Newly-opened fonts default to allowing kerning. This is generally a good
policy unless you have a strong reason to disable it, as it tends to
produce better rendering (with kerning disabled, some fonts might render
the word <code>kerning</code> as something that looks like
<code>keming</code> for example).

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_ttf 2.0.0.
