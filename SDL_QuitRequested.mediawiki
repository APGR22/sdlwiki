= SDL_QuitRequested =
Use this function to see whether an SDL_QUIT event is queued.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_bool SDL_QuitRequested(void)
```

== Return Value ==
Returns SDL_TRUE if SDL_QUIT is queued or SDL_FALSE otherwise.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This is actually a macro that calls [[SDL_PumpEvents]]() followed by [[SDL_PeepEvents]](). Since it pumps the event queue, it can only be used in the main thread.

It's perfectly normal for applications to just look for SDL_QUIT in their event loop, too, without using this macro.
