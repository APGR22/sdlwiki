=== Complete ===
* <<Color2(green, Sam: Mousewheel has a separate event)>>

=== Required ===
* Ryan: Add support for multiple mice
* Q: What is the mapping of individual mice to pointers?  Is there a "master pointer" that multiple mice share and then events for the individual mice?  Is there a dual mode, where you have a single pointer that all mice affect, and you can switch to multiple pointers, each affected by a single mouse?
* Sam: Support showing / hiding the cursor
* Sam: Reimplement mouse grab support

* Verify proper behavior with Vista DPI scaling

=== Wishlist ===
* ???: Pressure/tilt support for tablet like devices
* Sam: Add support color cursors
* Sam: Add support animated cursors

== Keyboard Input ==

=== Required ===
* ???: Add support for multiple keyboards (wishlist?)
* <<Color2(green, Sam: Create new text input event separate from key events)>>
* Q: When you're enabling or disabling text events via keystroke, how do you ignore the text generated by the key that is toggling text input?
    A: Key events are guaranteed to happen first
* Q: How do you handle key repeat?
* Sam/Jiang: Create IME API and support system IME interfaces
* Windows
* <<Color2(green, Mac OS X)>>
* Linux
* Sam: Add name to keysym and name to scancode lookup functions

== Joystick Input ==

=== Required ===
* ???: Create multi-touch input API

== Multi-threading ==

=== Complete ===
* <<Color2(green, Sam: Create API for getting the number of CPUs)>>
* <<Color2(green, Windows)>>
