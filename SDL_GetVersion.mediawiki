= SDL_GetVersion =

Get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_GetVersion(SDL_version * ver);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''ver'''
|the [[SDL_version]] structure that contains the version information
|}

== Remarks ==

If you are linking to SDL dynamically, then it is possible that the
current version will be different than the version you compiled against.
This function returns the current version, while [[SDL_VERSION]]() is a
macro that tells you what version you compiled with.

This function may be called safely at any time, even before [[SDL_Init]]().

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
SDL_version compiled;
SDL_version linked;

SDL_VERSION(&compiled);
SDL_GetVersion(&linked);
printf("We compiled against SDL version %d.%d.%d ...\n",
       compiled.major, compiled.minor, compiled.patch);
printf("But we are linking against SDL version %d.%d.%d.\n",
       linked.major, linked.minor, linked.patch);
</syntaxhighlight>
