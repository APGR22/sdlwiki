= SDL_GetVersion =
Use this function to get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_GetVersion(SDL_version* ver)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''ver'''
|a pointer to the [[SDL_version]] structure that contains the version information
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
SDL_version compiled;
SDL_version linked;

SDL_VERSION(&compiled);
SDL_GetVersion(&linked);
printf("We compiled against SDL version %d.%d.%d ...\n",
       compiled.major, compiled.minor, compiled.patch);
printf("But we linked against SDL version %d.%d.%d.\n",
       linked.major, linked.minor, linked.patch);
```

== Remarks ==
If you are linking to SDL dynamically, then it is possible that the current version will be different than the version you compiled against.  This function returns the current version number.

[[SDL_VERSION]] is a macro that tells you what version you compiled against.

This function may be called safely at any time, even before [[SDL_Init]]().
