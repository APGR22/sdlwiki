= SDL_AddEventWatch =
Use this function to add a callback to be triggered when an event is added to the event queue.


== Syntax ==
```c++
void SDL_AddEventWatch(SDL_EventFilter filter,
                       void*           userdata)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''filter'''
|the function to call when an event happens; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|'''userdata'''
|a pointer that is passed to '''filter'''
|}

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
<<Include(SDL_SetEventFilter, , , from="Start Include here.", to="##End Include here")>>
: where <code>YourEventFilter</code> is the name of your function and its parameters are:
 ||<code>userdata</code>||what was passed as '''userdata''' to [[SDL_AddEventWatch]]()||
 ||<code>event</code>||the event that triggered the callback||

: If '''filter''' returns 0 then the event will be dropped from the queue, otherwise the event queue will be preserved.

/!\ Be very careful of what you do in the event filter function, as it may run in a different thread!

If the quit event is generated by a signal (e.g. SIGINT), it will bypass the internal queue and either be delivered to the watch callback immediately, or arrive at the next event poll.
