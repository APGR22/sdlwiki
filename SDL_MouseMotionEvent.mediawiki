== Remarks ==
<<Color2(green,The following was taken from the old 1.2 wiki and may not be applicable to 1.3.)>>

[[SDL_MouseMotionEvent]]() is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_MOUSEMOTION is reported.
 Simply put, a SDL_MOUSEMOTION type event occurs when a user moves the mouse within the application window or when [[SDL_WarpMouse^InWindow^???]]() is called. Both the absolute ('''x''' and '''y''') and relative ('''xrel''' and '''yrel''') coordinates are reported along with the current button states ('''state'''). The button state can be interpreted using the SDL_BUTTON macro (see [[SDL_GetMouseState]]()).

If the cursor is hidden ([[SDL_ShowCursor]](0)) and the input is grabbed (SDL_WM_!GrabInput(SDL_GRAB_ON)), then the mouse will give relative motion events even when the cursor reaches the edge of the screen. This is currently only implemented on Windows and Linux/Unix-alikes. 

<<Color2(green,There are currently no pages for SDL_WarpMouse or SDL_WM_!GrabInput.  Do they still exist in 1.3?  Is [[SDL_WarpMouseInWindow]] the appropriate replacement for SDL_WarpMouse?  If it is should it be listed in RFs also?)>>
