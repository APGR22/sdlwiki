= SDL_MouseMotionEvent =
A structure that contains mouse motion event information.


== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''
|SDL_MOUSEMOTION
|-
|Uint32
|'''windowID'''
|the window with mouse focus, if any
|-
|Uint8
|'''state'''
|the current button state; see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|-
|int
|'''x'''
|X coordinate, relative to window
|-
|int
|'''y'''
|Y coordinate, relative to window
|-
|int
|'''xrel'''
|relative motion in the X direction
|-
|int
|'''yrel'''
|relative motion in the Y direction
|}


== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_MouseMotionEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] structure and is used when an event of type SDL_MOUSEMOTION is reported.

An SDL_MOUSEMOTION event occurs whenever a user moves the mouse within the application window or when [[SDL_WarpMouseInWindow]]() is called. 

'''state''' is an 8-bit button bitmask of the current button state and is the same as that returned by [[SDL_GetMouseState]]().  You can test different buttons by using the following masks:
{|
|SDL_BUTTON_LMASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_MMASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_RMASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_X1MASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_X2MASK
|}

Relative motion is stored in '''xrel''' and '''yrel''' and is relative to the last motion event.  If relative mouse mode is enabled with [[SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode]](), then the mouse will give relative motion events even when the cursor reaches the edge of the screen.
