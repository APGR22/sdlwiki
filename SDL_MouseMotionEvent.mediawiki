== Data Fields ==
{|
|Uint32
|'''type'''

== Remarks ==
[[SDL_MouseMotionEvent]] is a member of the [[SDL_Event]] union and is used when an event of type SDL_MOUSEMOTION is reported.  You would access it through the event's <code>motion</code> field.

An SDL_MOUSEMOTION event occurs whenever a user moves the mouse within the application window or when [[SDL_WarpMouseInWindow]]() is called. 

'''state''' is a 32-bit button bitmask of the current button state and is the same as that returned by [[SDL_GetMouseState]]().  You can test different buttons by using the following masks:
{|
|SDL_BUTTON_LMASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_MMASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_RMASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_X1MASK
|-
|SDL_BUTTON_X2MASK
|}

'''which''' may be SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID, for events that were generated by a touch input device, and not a real mouse. You might want to ignore such events, if your application already handles [[SDL_TouchFingerEvent]].

Relative motion is stored in '''xrel''' and '''yrel''' and is relative to the last motion event.  If relative mouse mode is enabled with [[SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode]](), then the mouse will give relative motion events even when the cursor reaches the edge of the screen.
