= SDL_Quit =
Use this function to clean up all initialized subsystems.  You should call it upon all exit conditions.


== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_Quit(void)
</syntaxhighlight>

== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
#include "SDL.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Unable to initialize SDL:  %s\n", SDL_GetError());
        return 1;
    }
    atexit(SDL_Quit);

    /* ... */

    return 0;
}
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
You should call this function even if you have already shutdown each initialized subsystem with [[SDL_QuitSubSystem]](). It is safe to call this function even in the case of errors in initialization.

If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function (for example [[SDL_VideoInit]]()) instead of [[SDL_Init]]() or [[SDL_InitSubSystem]](), then you must use that subsystem's quit function ([[SDL_VideoQuit]]()) to shut it down before calling SDL_Quit().

You can use this function with atexit() to ensure that it is run when your application is shutdown, but it is not wise to do this from a library or other dynamically loaded code.
