<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
SDL_bool SDL_SetHintWithPriority(const char *name,
                                 const char *value,
                                 SDL_HintPriority priority);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''name'''
|the hint to set
|-
|'''value'''

|-
|'''priority'''
|the [[SDL_HintPriority]] level for the hint
|}

== Return Value ==

The priority controls the behavior when setting a hint that already has a
value. Hints will replace existing hints of their priority and lower.
Environment variables are considered to have override priority.
