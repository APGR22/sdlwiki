<<Color2(green,Should map and format_version be gray because they're private?  Should SDL_BlitMap have a page or have the link removed?  There are more descriptions in the old wiki such as "the length of a surface scanline in bytes" for '''pitch'''.  Should any of those be moved here to clarify the information that this struct holds even though it's mostly read-only?)>>

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
This structure should be treated as read-only, except for '''pixels''', which, if not NULL, contains the raw pixel data for the surface.

The currently supported '''flags''' for [[SDL_Surface]] are:<br/>
or<br/>
'''flags''' may be 0 or any of the following OR'd together:
{|
|SDL_PREALLOC
|surface uses preallocated memory
|-
|SDL_RLEACCEL
|surface is RLE encoded
|}

<<Color2(green,There are MANY more flags listed in the old wiki.  Should any of them be moved here?  http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_Surface)>>

^The following^ Evaluates to true if the surface needs to be locked before access.
 ```
#define SDL_MUSTLOCK(S) (((S)->flags & SDL_RLEACCEL) != 0)
```
<<Color2(green,I don't know where the above came from...)>>

*<br/>An [[SDL_Surface]] represents an area of graphical memory that can be drawn to. The video framebuffer is returned as an [[SDL_Surface]] by [[SDL_SetVideoMode]]() and [[SDL_GetVideoSurface]](). 

<<Color2(green,The two above functions are not in 1.3.  Have they been replaced?)>><br/>*
