====== (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= Mix_GetNumChunkDecoders =

Get a list of chunk/music decoders that this build of SDL_mixer provides.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int Mix_GetNumChunkDecoders(void);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Return Value ==

Returns number of chunk decoders

== Remarks ==

This list can change between builds AND runs of the program, if external
libraries that add functionality become available. You must successfully
call [[Mix_OpenAudio]]() before calling these functions. This API is only
available in SDL_mixer 1.2.9 and later.

Appearing in this list doesn't promise your specific audio file will
decode...but it's handy to know if you have, say, a functioning Timidity
install.

These return values are static, read-only data; do not modify or free it.
The pointers remain valid until you call [[Mix_CloseAudio]]().

== Code Examples ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int i;
const int total = Mix_GetNumChunkDecoders();
for (i = 0; i < total; i++) {
    printf("Supported chunk decoder: [%s]\n", Mix_GetChunkDecoder(i));
}
</syntaxhighlight>
