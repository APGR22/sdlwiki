====== (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= Mix_UnregisterAllEffects =

You may not need to call this explicitly, unless you need to stop all effects from processing in the middle of a chunk's playback.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int Mix_UnregisterAllEffects(int channel);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''channel'''
|channel
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns zero if error (no such channel), nonzero if all effects removed.
Error messages can be retrieved from [[Mix_GetError]]().

== Remarks ==

Note that this will also shut off some internal effect processing, since
[[Mix_SetPanning]]() and others may use this API under the hood. This is
called internally when a channel completes playback. Posteffects are never
implicitly unregistered as they are for channels, but they may be
explicitly unregistered through this function by specifying
[[MIX_CHANNEL_POST]] for a channel.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_mixer 2.0.0.
