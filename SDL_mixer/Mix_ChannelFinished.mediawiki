====== (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= Mix_ChannelFinished =

Add your own callback when a channel has finished playing.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void Mix_ChannelFinished(void (SDLCALL *channel_finished)(int channel));
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''channel_finished'''
|callback function
|}

== Remarks ==

NULL to disable callback. The callback may be called from the mixer's audio
callback or it could be called as a result of [[Mix_HaltChannel]](), etc.
do not call SDL_LockAudio() from this callback; you will either be inside
the audio callback, or SDL_mixer will explicitly lock the audio before
calling your callback.
