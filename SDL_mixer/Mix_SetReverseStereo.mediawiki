====== (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= Mix_SetReverseStereo =

Causes a channel to reverse its stereo.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int Mix_SetReverseStereo(int channel, int flip);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''channel'''
|channel
|-
|'''flip'''
|flip
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns zero if error (no such channel or [[Mix_RegisterEffect]]() fails),
nonzero if reversing effect is enabled. Note that an audio device in mono
mode is a no-op, but this call will return successful in that case. Error
messages can be retrieved from [[Mix_GetError]]().

== Remarks ==

This is handy if the user has his speakers hooked up backwards, or you
would like to have a minor bit of psychedelia in your sound code. :)
Calling this function with (flip) set to non-zero reverses the chunks's
usual channels. If (flip) is zero, the effect is unregistered.

This uses the [[Mix_RegisterEffect]]() API internally, and thus is probably
more CPU intensive than having the user just plug in his speakers
correctly. [[Mix_SetReverseStereo]]() returns without registering the
effect function if the audio device is not configured for stereo output.

If you specify [[MIX_CHANNEL_POST]] for (channel), then this the effect is
used on the final mixed stream before sending it on to the audio device (a
posteffect).

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_mixer 2.0.0.
