= Style Guide: Tutorials =

The [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/Tutorials Tutorials] page provides links to many different resources for help with using SDL.  This guide provides instructions for adding your tutorial to the Tutorials page. 

<span id="ToC"></span>

== General Guidelines ==
''Most tutorials on the Tutorials page are external resources.  This guide will help you add an external tutorial to the list as well as detail how to create a new tutorial from within the wiki if you prefer.''

'''Please post appropriate tutorials that may benefit other users.  
* Do not post anything that you do not have permission to post publicly.'''
<br/>
<br/>
== Adding An Existing Tutorial ==
''The following instructions apply if you have already created your tutorial.  If you still need to create your tutorial see [[Creating A New Tutorial]] below first.''
 1. Begin by going to the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/Tutorials Tutorials] page and selecting <<Color2(blue,Edit (Text))>> or <<Color2(blue,Edit (GUI))>> in the left column to begin editing.
  ~-Reminder: Markup info provided here is specifically for use in the Text editor but should work in both.-~
 1. Scroll down in the edit window to the section that best fits your tutorial (eg: ```== Video ==```, {{{== Audio ==}}}, etc.).
: See [[heading|Creating A New Heading]] if one does not exist.
 1. Find information relevant to your tutorial in the style guide sections [[#formatting|below]] and apply the appropriate formatting as you create your content.
 1. Preview your work as you go by clicking <<Color2(blue,Preview)>> in the left column.  
 1. Save your work when you are satisfied with your edits by clicking <<Color2(blue,Save Changes)>> in the left column.  
For additional assistance with editing, saving, or wiki-appropriate markup see the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/SGWikiBasics Wiki Basics] Style Guide.

== Formatting Your Tutorial ==

=== Location ===
You may place your tutorial listing anywhere within the relevant section.  
: It is our hope that tutorials discussing the same specific topic will be grouped together within each section.

<span id="heading"></span>
=== Creating A New Heading ===
'''Please use existing headings as much as possible.'''

''If'' your tutorial does not fit into any of the existing headings you may create a new heading for it.  The headings should roughly match those found on the [http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/APIByCategory API by Category] page.  

To create a new heading:
: ''Markup'': Place the following markup at the location for the new heading.
  ```== Heading ==```
: Replace "<code>Heading</code>" with the new heading name (ie: Initialization, Events, etc.)
: Return to [[Adding An Existing Tutorial]] to complete the process.









===  ===
When your remark includes a reference to a function parameter:
{|
|<( |3 30%>''If'' you are referencing a parameter __on the same page__
|''Action'': Use '''bold''' wherever the name is used in the remark.
|-
|''Markup'':  Use 3 apostrophes on either side of the text for bold.<br/>```'''parameter'''``` = '''parameter'''
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_ConvertAudio]]()
|-
|<( |3>''If'' you are referencing a parameter __from another page__
|''Action'': Use <code>monospace</code> wherever the name is used in the remark.
|-
|''Markup'':  Use a single backtick on either side of the text for monospace.<br/>```<code>member</code>``` = <code>member</code>
|-
|''Example'': [[SDL_OpenAudio]]()
|}


=== Referencing Structure Data Fields ===
''If'' your remark includes a reference to a structure data field:
: ''Action'': Use the same formatting as for [[#params|function parameters]] above.
: ''Example'': [[SDL_AudioSpec]]


=== Referencing Enumeration Values ===
''If'' your remark includes a reference to an enumeration value:
: ''Action'': No special formatting is required since these are generally already in ALL CAPS.
: ''Example'': [[SDL_GLattr]]


=== Referencing Other API Components ===
''If'' your remark includes a reference to an SDL function, enumeration, or structure:
: ''Action'': Create a hyperlink to its page.
: ~-Although the wiki will automatically create links in many cases, it does not recognize the SDL names correctly so you must manually hyperlink them.-~<br/>

: ''Markup'':  Use two brackets surrounding the page name (```[[ ]]```) to create a link.
: ~-Using the full page address is not necessary.  The page name portion (end of address) is sufficient but must be exact.-~

 ||<( |2 30%>''If'' you reference a __function__||''Action'': Include open and closed parentheses outside of the hyperlink markup.||
 ||''Markup'':  ```[[SDL_Function]]()``` = [[SDL_Function]]()||
 ||<( |2>''If'' you reference a __structure__ or __enumeration__||''Action'': Do not use parentheses.||
 ||''Markup'':  ```[[SDL_Enumeration/Structure]]``` = [[SDL_Enumeration/Structure]]||
 ||||<(>''Example'': [[SDL_SetTextureScaleMode]]()||
