= SDL_GameControllerEventState =
Use this function to find the current state of, enable, or disable events dealing with Game Controllers. This will not disable Joystick events, which can also be fired by a controller (see [[SDL_JoystickEventState]]()).




== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
int SDL_GameControllerEventState(int state)
</syntaxhighlight>


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''state'''
|can be one of SDL_QUERY, SDL_IGNORE, or SDL_ENABLE
|}
Note: You may use -1, 0, or 1 in place of SDL_QUERY, SDL_IGNORE, or SDL_ENABLE respectively.


== Return Value ==
Returns the same value passed to the function, with exception to -1 (SDL_QUERY), which will return the current state.

== Code Examples ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
printf("%i\n", SDL_GameControllerEventState(SDL_QUERY));  /* prints 1 */
printf("%i\n", SDL_GameControllerEventState(SDL_IGNORE)); /* prints 0 */
printf("%i\n", SDL_GameControllerEventState(SDL_QUERY));  /* prints 0 */
</syntaxhighlight>

== Remarks ==
If controller events are disabled, you must call [[SDL_GameControllerUpdate]]() yourself and check the state of the controller when you want controller information.

Any number can be passed to [[SDL_GameControllerEventState]](), but only -1, 0, and 1 will have any effect. Other numbers will just be returned.


== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
