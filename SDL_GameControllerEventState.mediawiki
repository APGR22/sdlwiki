Use this function to find the current state of, enable, or disable events dealing with Game Controllers. This will not disable Joystick events, which can also be fired by a controller (See [[SDL_JoystickEventState]])




== Syntax ==
```c++
int SDL_GameControllerEventState(int state)
```


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''state'''
|can be one of SDL_QUERY, SDL_IGNORE, or SDL_ENABLE
|}
Note: You may use -1, 0, or 1 in place of SDL_QUERY, SDL_IGNORE, or SDL_ENABLE respectively.


== Return Value ==
Returns the same value passed to the function, with exception to -1 (SDL_QUERY), which will return the current state.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
cout << SDL_GameControllerEventState(SDL_QUERY)  << endl; // 1
cout << SDL_GameControllerEventState(SDL_IGNORE) << endl; // 0
cout << SDL_GameControllerEventState(SDL_QUERY)  << endl; // 0
```


== Remarks ==
Any number can be passed to SDL_GameControllerEventState, but only -1, 0, and 1 will have any effect. Other numbers will just be returned.
