= SDL_RenderGetLogicalSize =

Get device independent resolution for rendering.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
void SDL_RenderGetLogicalSize(SDL_Renderer * renderer, int *w, int *h);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''renderer'''
|a rendering context
|-
|'''w'''
|an int to be filled with the width
|-
|'''h'''
|an int to be filled with the height
|}

== Remarks ==

When using the main rendering target (eg no target texture is set): this
may return 0 for <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> if the [[SDL_Renderer]]
has never had its logical size set by [[SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize]]().
Otherwise it returns the logical width and height.

When using a target texture: Never return 0 for <code>w</code> and
<code>h</code> at first. Then it returns the logical width and height that
are set.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
