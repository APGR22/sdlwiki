This is a scratch pad for the IME Summer of Code 2010 project, by Daniel Wyatt

== Status ==
""June 30, 2010""
I have decided to use an IMM implementation for the SoC.
The TSF implementation is moving too slowly, I intend to complete it after the SoC.

== Documentation ==

== Notes ==
There are two methods for enabling IME support on Windows:
* [[#TSF|Text Services Framework (TSF)]]
* [[#IMM|Input Method Manager (IMM)]]

I will write an IMM implementation for the SoC.

The TSF comes with Windows XP and newer.
For earlier versions of Windows, you must install it separately: [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b4c50c6e-e9dd-4c58-a886-75bd56985f0f&DisplayLang=en Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework Redist files]

=== TSF ===
The TSF is the new standard for text input and supports advanced features such as dictation. It is a collection of (many) COM interfaces.

=== IMM ===
The IMM is the old way of doing things. On Windows XP and newer, the IMM is emulated by the TSF behind the scenes.
