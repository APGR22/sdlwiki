= SDL_ConvertSurface =
Use this function to create a new surface of the specified format, and then copy and map the given surface to it so the blit of the converted surface will be as fast as possible.


== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Surface* SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface*     src,
                                SDL_PixelFormat* fmt,
                                Uint32           flags)
```

== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''src'''
|the surface to copy and map from
|-
|'''fmt'''
|the [[SDL_PixelFormat]] to apply
|-
|'''flags'''
|;see [[#Remarks|Remarks]] for details
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns the new surface, or NULL if this function fails; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++
You can add your code example here
```

== Remarks ==
The '''flags''' parameter is passed to [[SDL_CreateRGBSurface]]() and has those semantics. You can also pass SDL_RLEACCEL in the '''flags''' parameter and SDL will try to RLE accelerate colorkey and alpha blits in the resulting surface.
