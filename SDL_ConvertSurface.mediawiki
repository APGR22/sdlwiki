= SDL_ConvertSurface =
Use this function to copy an existing surface into a new one that is optimized for blitting to a surface of a specified pixel format. 



== Syntax ==
```c++
SDL_Surface* SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface*     src,
                                SDL_PixelFormat* fmt,
                                Uint32           flags)
```


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''src'''
|the existing [[SDL_Surface]] structure to convert
|-
|'''fmt'''
|the [[SDL_PixelFormat]] structure that the new surface is optimized for
|-
|'''flags'''
|the flags are unused and should be set to 0
|}

== Return Value ==
Returns the new [[SDL_Surface]] structure that is created or NULL if it fails; call [[SDL_GetError]]() for more information.

== Code Examples ==
```c++

```

== Remarks ==
This function is used to optimize images for faster ''repeat'' blitting.  This is accomplished by converting the original and storing the result as a new surface. The new, optimized surface can then be used as the source for future blits, making them faster.
