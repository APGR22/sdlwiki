== Code Examples ==

== Remarks ==
A custom force feedback effect is much like a periodic effect, where the application can define ''its'' exact shape. You will have to allocate the data yourself.
<!-- <span style="color: green;">I think this should be a new paragraph or moved down to connect to the next one.</span> --> '''data''' should consist of '''channels''' * '''samples''' Uint16 samples. <!-- <span style="color: green;">This is basically repeated above. Is there a better way to say this and still be correct and readable to programmers but also to people who speak English?</span> -->

If '''channels''' is 1, the effect is rotated using the defined direction. Otherwise it uses the samples in '''data''' for the different axes.
