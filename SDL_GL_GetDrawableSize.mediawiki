= SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize =
Use this function to get the size of a window's underlying drawable (for use with glViewport).

```c++
void SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(SDL_Window* window,
                            int*        w,
                            int*        h)
```


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the Window from which the drawable size should be queried
|-
|'''w'''
|a Pointer to variable for storing the width, may be NULL
|-
|'''h'''
|a Pointer to variable for storing the height, may be NULL

== Remarks ==

This may differ from SDL_GetWindowSize if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with [[SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI]] on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the [[SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED]] hint.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
