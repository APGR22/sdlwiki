= SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize =
Use this function to get the size of a window's underlying drawable in pixels (for use with glViewport).




== Syntax ==
<syntaxhighlight lang='c++'>
void SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize(SDL_Window* window,
                            int*        w,
                            int*        h)
</syntaxhighlight>


== Function Parameters ==
{|
|'''window'''
|the window from which the drawable size should be queried
|-
|'''w'''
|a pointer to variable for storing the width in pixels, may be NULL
|-
|'''h'''
|a pointer to variable for storing the height in pixels, may be NULL
|}



== Remarks ==

This may differ from [[SDL_GetWindowSize]]() if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the [[SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED]] hint.

== Version ==
This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
