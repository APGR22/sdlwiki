= SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK =
A hint that specifies whether the Android / iOS built-in accelerometer should be listed as a joystick device, rather than listing actual joysticks only.




== Values ==
{|
|0
|list only real joysticks and accept input from them
|-
|1
|list real joysticks along with the accelerometer as if it were a 3 axis joystick (the default)
|}


== Default ==
By default SDL will list real joysticks along with the accelerometer as if it were a 3 axis joystick.


== Code Examples ==
```c++
#include "SDL.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // This disables the use of gyroscopes as axis device
    SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK, "0");
}

```
