= SDL_RegisterEvents =

Allocate a set of user-defined events, and return the beginning event number for that set of events.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
Uint32 SDL_RegisterEvents(int numevents);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''numevents'''
|the number of events to be allocated
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns The beginning event number, or (Uint32)-1 if there are not enough
user-defined events left.

== Remarks ==

Calling this function with <code>numevents</code> <= 0 is an error and will
return (Uint32)-1.

Note, (Uint32)-1 means the maximum unsigned 32-bit integer value (or
0xFFFFFFFF), but is clearer to write.

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
